          Disclosure allows VA to accurately determine whether certain Veterans
          will be charged copays for care and medications, their eligibility for
          other services and enrollment. Veterans are not required to disclose
          their financial information; however, VA is not currently enrolling new
          applicants who decline to provide their financial information unless they
          have other qualifying eligibility factors (i.e., a former Prisoner of
          War, in <strong>receipt of a Purple Heart, discharged for a disability incurred or
          aggravated in the line of duty, receiving VA service-connected disability
          compensation, receiving VA pension, in receipt of Medicaid benefits, or a
          recently discharged Combat Veteran (e.g., OEF/OIF/OND), who was
          discharged within the past 5 years are eligible for enrollment without
          disclosing their financial information)</strong> but like other Veterans may
          provide their financial information to establish their eligibility for
          travel assistance, cost-free medications and/or medical care for services
          unrelated to military experience.
