If you are enrolled in a program at an approved Institution of Higher Learning (IHL) that provides cooperative (co-op) training, you may use VA educational assistance benefits to cover your costs. Co-op training is an educational program requiring periods of full-time work or training alternating with periods of full-time instruction.

### Are you eligible for benefits?

Yes, if: 

- You are using VA educational assistance
- You are pursuing an educational program that requires part-time study and part-time work or training

#### Who is covered
- You

#### Available benefits 
- Tuition assistance

#### How it works

The amount covered under VA educational assistance depends on the benefit you use. 

- The Post-9/11 GI Bill®: If the program is at a public IHL, VA pays the actual costs for public in-state tuition and fees. If the program is at a private or foreign IHL, VA pays the lesser of the [national maximum](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp) or the actual costs for in-state tuition and fees. Housing and educational-supplies stipend benefits are also paid under full-time enrollment.
- All other GI Bill® programs: VA pays a monthly rate that varies depending on which GI Bill® program you are entitled to use. [View current payment rates](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp)
