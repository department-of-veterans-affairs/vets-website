The Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship (Fry Scholarship) provides Post-9/11 GI Bill® benefits to the children and surviving spouses of Service Members who died in the line of duty while on active duty after September 10, 2001. If you qualify, and are attending school, you may receive up to 36 months of benefits at the 100% level. Full in-state tuition costs are covered at public institutions; up to $20,235 per year will be paid for training at private institutions.
 
### Are you eligible for compensation?

Yes, if: 
You are the child or surviving spouse of an active-duty Service Member who died in the line of duty on or after September 11, 2001

### Who is covered
Dependents/survivors

### Available benefits 
Fry Scholarship (GI Bill® benefits)

### How it works
Children are eligible on their 18th birthday or after graduating high school, whichever comes first. Scholarship funds must be spent before the student’s 33rd birthday. A spouse has 15 years from the Service Members death to use the benefit.

If you are a dependent and your parent died in the line of duty before August 1, 2011, you may be eligible for both the Fry Scholarship and [DEA](link to Beta Dependents’ Educational Assistance), but you can use only one program at a time. Combined benefits are capped at 81 months of full-time training.
 
Surviving spouses are eligible to receive [Dependency Indemnity Compensation](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/types-dependency_and_indemnity.asp) while using the Fry Scholarship. Children over 18 who receive DIC will need to give up those payments when they start to use the Fry Scholarship.

**Exception:** Upon remarriage, a spouse will lose eligibility for this benefit. 


### Apply
Use the [GI Bill® Comparison Tool](LINK) to help you choose a school. Make sure that your selected program is approved for VA training.

Fill out [VA Form 22-5490 (Dependents Application for VA Education Benefits)](http://www.va.gov/vaforms/form_detail.asp?FormNo=22-5490) . Send it to the VA regional office that has jurisdiction over the state where you will advance your education and training. If you are a son or daughter under legal age, a parent or guardian must sign the application. When applying, you will be required to make an irrevocable election of either the Fry Scholarship or the Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program. 

If you have already started your educational program, take your application to your school or employer. Ask them to complete VA Form 22-1999 (Enrollment Certification) and send both forms to VA. You can submit an Enrollment Certification online using VA-ONCE. (Note: Schools must contact their VA representative to receive this form.)
