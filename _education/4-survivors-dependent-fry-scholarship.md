### How it works

Children are eligible as of their 18th birthday or after graduating high school, whichever comes first. Childrens' eligibility ends on their 33rd birthday. A spouse has 15 years from the Servicemember's death to use the benefit.

If you are a dependent and your parent died in the line of duty before August 1, 2011, you may be eligible for both the Fry Scholarship and [DEA]({{ site.url }}/education/survivors-dependent-assistance/dependents-education/), but you can use only one program at a time. Combined benefits are capped at 81 months of full-time training.

Surviving spouses are eligible to receive [Dependency and Indemnity Compensation](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/types-dependency_and_indemnity.asp) while using the Fry Scholarship. Children over 18 who receive DIC benefits will need to give up those payments when they start to use the Fry Scholarship.

**Exception:** Upon remarriage, a spouse will lose eligibility for this benefit.

### Apply

Use the [GI Bill速 Comparison Tool]({{ site.url }}/gi-bill-comparison-tool/) to help you choose a school. Make sure that your selected program is approved for VA training.

Fill out [VA Form 22-5490 (Dependents' Application for VA Education Benefits)](http://www.va.gov/vaforms/form_detail.asp?FormNo=22-5490). Send it to the VA regional office that has jurisdiction over the state where you will advance your education and training. If you are a son or daughter under legal age, a parent or guardian must sign the application. When applying, you will be required to make an irrevocable election of either the Fry Scholarship or the Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program.

If you have already started your educational program, take your application to your school or employer. Ask them to complete VA Form 22-1999 (Enrollment Certification) and send both forms to VA. You can submit an Enrollment Certification online using VA-ONCE. **Note:** Schools must contact their VA representative to receive this form.
