The time it takes to process your education or training claim depends on your regional office. There are four regional claims processing centers. You can use [VA’s interactive map](http://www.vba.va.gov/reports/aspiremap.asp) to find out how quickly your regional office is processing claims.

### How it works:

#### 1. Research

- 	Learn about schools offering VA-approved programs by using the [comparison tool](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/comparison_tool.asp) or (http://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/gi-bill-comparison-tool/).
-	Decide [which school] (http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/choosing_a_school.asp) is best for you.
-	Please note that it is not required, but is an option, to apply to a chosen school prior to applying for benefits.

#### 2. Prepare Documents

The following documents will help VA process your claim:

-	DD214 (Member 4) for all periods of active-duty service, excluding active duty for training
-	DD2384, Notice of Basic Eligibility (NOBE), which you can obtain through your Reserve unit
-	Orders if activated from the Guard/Reserves
-	Discharge or separation papers (DD214 or equivalent)

#### 3. Apply

You have four options for filing your claim:

-	Apply online using [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vonapp).
-	Go to a [VA regional office]({{ site.url }}/education/process/regional-office/index.html) and have a VA employee assist you.
-	Work with the VA Certifying Official, who is usually in the Registrar or Financial Aid office, at the school of your choice.
-	Call 888-GI BILL (888-442-4551) to have the application mailed to you. After you complete it, mail it to your [VA regional claims processing office](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/regional_processing.asp).

#### 4. VA Review
You can track the status of your application on [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/manage/status).
