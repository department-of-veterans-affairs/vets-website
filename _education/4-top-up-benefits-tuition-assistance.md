If your tuition cost amounts to more than what's covered by the Tuition Assistance (TA) program, you may be eligible for additional assistance. Tuition Assistance Top-Up covers the difference between the full cost of a college course and the amount covered under active-duty TA for up to 36 months.

### Are you Eligible for Compensation?

Yes, if: 
- You are approved for federal TA
- You are eligible for Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty or Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits
- Your desired course tuition and fees total more than TA will cover

### Who's covered
You

### Available Benefits
- Additional tuition funding  

### How it works
If you are utilizing the Montgomery GI Bill, you will receive the difference between the DOD payment and the total cost of the course. If you get assistance through the Post-9/11 GI Bill, your school will be reimbursed the difference between the DOD payment and the authorized maximum tuition and fees.

***NOTE:*** You are highly encouraged to consult with your education officer and the [GI Bill Comparison Tool]({{ site.url }}/gibill/)) before utilizing this benefit. Your use of Top-Up will affect your GI bill payments, and you should carefully consider your situation before applying for this benefit. If you intend to take additional courses after leaving the military, you should calculate whether your remaining GI Bill benefits will cover your needs.
- If you utilize the Montgomery GI Bill, this benefit will be reduced, or charged, one month of entitlement for each payment received that is equal to the full-time monthly [GI Bill rate](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp)
- If you utilize the Post-9/11 GI Bill, this benefit will be charged based on training time no matter how much money you are reimbursed. Half-time training rates reduce your GI Bill benefit by a half-month for each month you are enrolled.

**Exception:** In no case will the combined amount paid by DOD and VA exceed the total cost of the course.
