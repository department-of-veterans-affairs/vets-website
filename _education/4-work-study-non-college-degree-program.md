### Are you eligible for benefits?

Yes, if:

- You qualify for the GI Bill®
-	You enroll, or plan to enroll, in a non-degree program at an approved institution

#### Who is covered

- You and/or your dependents

#### Available benefits

- Significant tuition assistance
- Books and supplies stipend

#### How it works

Benefits depend on which GI Bill® program you use and the school you attend. VA pays you at the end of each month for the hours you have spent training, and provides a monthly housing allowance based on the location of the school. You may receive up to $83 per month for books and supplies.

Post-9/11 GI Bill®: For training offered at non-degree schools, VA pays for in-state tuition and fees up to the [national maximum](http://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp).

Other GI Bill® programs: VA pays a monthly rate that depends on your specific program and your length of active service. [View current payment rates](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp)
