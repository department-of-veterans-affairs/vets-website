### Are you Eligible for Compensation?

Yes, if:

- You entered service for the first time between January 1, 1977, and June 30, 1985
- You opened and contributed to your account before April 1, 1987
- You voluntarily contributed $25 - $2700

#### Available benefits: 

- Tuition assistance

#### How it works: 

VEAP benefits can be applied to the following programs:

- college degree and certificate programs
- technical or vocational courses
- flight training
- apprenticeship or on-the-job training
- high-tech training
- licensing and certification tests
- entrepreneurship training
- certain entrance exams
- correspondence courses

VEAP may also be used for remedial, deficiency and refresher courses. Your monthly contributions will determine the length of your entitlements (1-36 months), and you have 10 years from your release from Active Duty to use VEAP benefits. If VEAP benefits go unused after that 10 year period, the amount left in your fund will be automatically refunded.

*Active Duty*
If you are currently Active Duty and wish to receive VEAP, you must have at least 3 months of contributions available.

*Withdrawals*
Contributions may be withdrawn if you do not meet basic eligibility requirements or if you formally request a refund.
