## Veterans Education Assistance Program (VEAP)

If you are interested in pursuing continuing educational programs, and are willing to make contributions from your military pay, the VEAP is a $2-to-$1 government match program for education assistance.

### Are you Eligible for Benefits?

Yes, if:

- you entered service for the first time between January 1, 1977 and June 30, 1985
- you opened and contributed to your account before April 1, 1987
- you voluntarily contributed $25 - $2700

#### Available benefits:
Tuition assistance

#### How it works:

VEAP benefits can be applied to the following programs:

- college degree and certificate programs
- technical or vocational courses
- flight training
- apprenticeship or on-the-job training
- high-tech training
- licensing and certification tests
- entrepreneurship training
- certain entrance exams
- correspondence courses

VEAP may also be used for remedial, deficiency and refresher courses. Your monthly contributions will determine the length of your entitlements (1-36 months), and you have 10 years from your release from Active Duty to use VEAP benefits. If VEAP benefits go unused after that 10 year period, you can request a refund for the amount left in your fund.

*Active Duty*
If you are currently Active Duty and wish to receive VEAP, you must have at least 3 months of contributions available.

*Withdrawals*
Contributions may be withdrawn if you do not meet basic eligibility requirements or if you formally request a refund.
