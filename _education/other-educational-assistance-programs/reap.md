<div markdown="1">[REAP ended](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/reap.asp) on November 25, 2015, but under the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016, some REAP benefits will remain in place for three more years. The [Post-9/11 GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/) has replaced REAP, providing educational assistance benefits for Reserve and National Guard members called to active duty on or after September 11, 2001. If you applied for REAP on or after November 25, 2015, your application will be reviewed and appropriate benefits will be applied, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill. If you would like to discontinue using REAP and use the Post-9/11 GI Bill instead, call 1-888-GIBILL-1 (1-888-442-4551).
