### How it works

VEAP benefits can be applied to the following programs:

- [Undergraduate and graduate programs](/education/gi-bill/higher-learning/)
- [Co-op training](/education/work-learn/co-op-training/)
- [Technical or vocational courses (non-college degree programs)](/education/work-learn/non-college-degree-program/)
- [Flight training](/education/advanced-training-and-certifications/flight-training/)
- [On-the-job training and apprenticeships](/education/work-learn/job-and-apprenticeship/)
- [Licensing and certification tests](/education/advanced-training-and-certifications/licensing-certification/)
- [Entrepreneurship training](/education/advanced-training-and-certifications/entrepreneurship-training/)
- [Certain entrance examinations (national testing)](/education/advanced-training-and-certifications/national-testing-program/)
- [Correspondence courses](/education/work-learn/non-traditional/correspondence-training/)
- Under certain circumstances, remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses

VEAP may also be used for remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses. Your monthly contributions will determine the length of your entitlements (1–36 months), and you have 10 years from your release from active duty to use VEAP benefits. If VEAP benefits go unused after that 10-year period, you can request a refund for the amount left in your fund.

**Active Duty**<br>
If you are currently on active duty and wish to receive VEAP, you must have at least three months of contributions available.

**Withdrawals**<br>
Contributions may be withdrawn if you do not meet basic eligibility requirements or if you formally request a refund.
