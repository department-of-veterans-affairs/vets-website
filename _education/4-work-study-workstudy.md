### Are you eligible for benefits?

Yes, if:

- You are enrolled at least three-quarter time at an institution of higher learning.
- You are using one of the following VA education benefits:

  - Post-9/11 GI Bill® ([Veterans](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/post911_gibill.asp) and [transfer-of-entitlement recipients](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/post911_transfer.asp))
  - Montgomery GI Bill® ([Active Duty](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/mgib_ad.asp) and [Selected Reserve](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/mgib_sr.asp))
  - [Reserve Educational Assistance Program](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/reap.asp)
  - [Veterans' Educational Assistance Program](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/veap.asp)
  - [Dependents’ Educational Assistance program](/education/survivors-dependent-assistance/dependents-education/) (**Note:** Eligible dependents under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 may use work study only while enrolled at an educational institution in one of the 50 states.)
  - [National Call to Service](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/national_call_to_service.asp)
  - [Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment program](http://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/index.asp)
- You are able to complete the work-study contract before the end of your eligibility for education benefits.

#### Available benefits

A part-time job while you study


#### How it works

The number of applicants selected will depend on the availability of VA-related work at your school or at VA facilities in your area. Veterans with service-connected disabilities of at least 30% may be given priority consideration.

#### Learn more

-	Download a copy of the [Application for Work-Study Allowance](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-22-8691-ARE.pdf).
-	Contact the [Regional Processing Office](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/regional_processing.asp) that handles your claim.

#### Services you perform under a VA work-study program must be related to VA work, such as:

- Working at a VA facility.
- Working at Department of Defense, Coast Guard, or National Guard facilities engaged in the administration of the Montgomery GI Bill® Selected Reserve or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program.
- Working at a state Veterans agency to help Veterans obtain Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment benefits.
- Working at a Center of Excellence for Veteran Student Success to support and coordinate the academic, financial, physical, and social needs of Veteran students.
- Working in a cooperative program carried out jointly by VA and an institution of higher learning.
- Working in any Veterans-related position in an institution of higher learning, such as providing assistance to Veteran students with general inquiries about Veteran benefits, processing necessary documents, or maintaining and organizing Veteran-related files.


#### How much will I earn?

You’ll earn an hourly wage equal to the federal minimum wage or your state minimum wage, whichever is greater. If you’re in a work-study job at a college or university, your school may pay you the difference between the amount VA pays and the amount the school normally pays other work-study students doing the same job.

You may elect to be paid in advance for 40% of the number of hours in your work-study agreement, or for 50 hours, whichever is fewer. After you’ve completed the hours covered by your first payment, VA will pay you each time you complete 50 hours of service, or biweekly, whichever comes first.

You may work during or between periods of enrollment. The total number of hours you work during your enrollment can’t be more than 25 times the number of weeks in your enrollment period.
