### How it works

Participation in these programs generally involves entering into a training contract for a specific amount of time with an employer or union. During training you will likely receive a salary from the employer or union, which typically increases as your skills increase. At the end of your training period, you will get a job certification or journeyman status.

Veterans in an approved program can use their GI Bill® benefit and receive a tax-free stipend. The Post-9/11 GI Bill® pays a monthly housing allowance (MHA), which is paid in addition to the entry-level wage. Take a look at the [OJT Fact Sheet for more information](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/docs/factsheets/OJT_Factsheet.pdf).

VA issues GI Bill® payments each month after receiving verification of your hours from your employer or union.

Your payment varies depending on the GI Bill® program. View the [payment rates](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp) for your GI Bill® program.

***Post-9/11 GI Bill® MHA Payment Rates***

- You will receive 100% of your applicable MHA during the first six months of training in these increments:
- 80% of your applicable MHA during the second six months of training
- 60% of your applicable MHA during the third six months of training
- 40% of your applicable MHA during the fourth six months of training
- 20% of your applicable MHA during the remainder of the training
- You will receive up to $83 per month for books and supplies.

***All other GI Bill® Programs Payment Rates***

- 75% of the full-time GI Bill® rate for the first six months of training
- 55% of the full-time GI Bill® rate for the second six months of training
- 35% of the full-time GI Bill® rate for the remainder of the training program


**Exception:** OJT is not available if you are an active-duty Servicemember, or to spouses using a transferred benefit.
