#### How it works

- [Undergraduate and graduate programs](/education/gi-bill/higher-learning/)
- [Co-op training](/education/work-learn/co-op-training/)
- [Technical or vocational courses (non-college degree programs)](/education/work-learn/non-college-degree-program/)

- [On-the-job training and apprenticeships](/education/work-learn/job-and-apprenticeship/)
- [High-tech training](/education/work-learn/non-traditional/accelerated-payments/) for Reservists pursuing a non-degree program of education lasting two years or less
- [Licensing and certification tests](/education/advanced-training-and-certifications/licensing-certification/)
- [Entrepreneurship training](/education/advanced-training-and-certifications/entrepreneurship-training/)

- [Correspondence courses](/education/work-learn/non-traditional/correspondence-training/)
- Under certain circumstances, remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses

VEAP may also be used for remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses. Your monthly contributions will determine the length of your entitlements (1–36 months), and you have 10 years from your release from active duty to use VEAP benefits. If VEAP benefits go unused after that 10-year period, you can request a refund for the amount left in your fund.

**Active Duty**

If you are currently on active duty and wish to receive VEAP, you must have at least three months of contributions available.

**Withdrawals**

Contributions may be withdrawn if you do not meet basic eligibility requirements or if you formally request a refund.
