- You are a Reservist activated for 90 days or more after September 11, 2001
- The activation was due to war or national emergency, as declared by the President of the United States or the United States Congress

### Who is covered
You and/or your dependents

### How it works
Under REAP, you may be able to receive assistance on some or all of your tuition and fees for college courses, certificate programs, and vocational training.

The amount of your benefit depends on your active-service time. See the [current benefit rates](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp#ch1607).You may get additional monthly benefits if you participate in the [Buy-Up program]({{ site.url }}/education/gi-bill/buy-up-program/).
