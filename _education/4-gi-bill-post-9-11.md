If you are seeking education or training opportunities and have served on active duty after September 10, 2001, you may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill®. This program is a major overhaul of the Montgomery GI Bill®.

### Are you eligible for benefits?

Yes, if:

-  You meet the basic requirements for any GI Bill® program
-  You have served on active duty for at least 90 days, whether continuous or interrupted, after September 10, 2001
-  You make an irrevocable election of the Post-9/11 GI Bill® (and forgo use of any other GI Bill®)

Making an “irrevocable election” means that you cannot change back to another GI Bill® program for which you may also be eligible after you receive Post-9/11 GI Bill® benefits.

#### Who is covered

- You and/or your dependents

#### Available benefits

- Significant tuition-funding assistance
- A location-adjusted housing allowance out of which you can pay your living expenses during enrollment

#### How it works

The benefit amount varies according to where you use the benefit and the amount of your active-duty service since September 10, 2001.

#### The program

- Covers the entire in-state tuition for state schools and up to the national maximum ($21,084.89) for private or foreign schools. Learn more
- Pays you the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) of an E-5 with dependents based on the cost of living for the specific location of your school.

**Example:** If you were attending University of California, Los Angeles, in 2015, you would receive a BAH of up to $2,433 a month while in school. If you were attending the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, you would receive up to $1,638 while in school.

- Provides up to 36 months of educational benefits, generally payable for 15 years following your release from active duty
- Uses a percentage-of-maximum-benefit scale based on how much active service you have had since September 10, 2001  

**Example:** If you have had 90 days of active service since September 10, 2001, you qualify for 40% of the maximum amount. Three years of active service qualifies you for 100% of the benefit.

#### Also includes

- The Yellow Ribbon Program, which provides additional support to cover higher private-school and out-of-state tuition and fees.
- The Transfer of Entitlement Option, which enables eligible Servicemembers to transfer all 36 months or a portion of Post-9/11 GI Bill® benefits to a spouse or children.
