#### How it works
Under REAP, you may be able to receive assistance with some or all of your tuition and fees for college courses, certificate programs, and vocational training.

The amount of your benefit depends on your active-service time. See the [current benefit rates](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp#ch1607). You may get additional monthly benefits if you participate in the [Buy-Up program](/education/gi-bill/buy-up-program/).
