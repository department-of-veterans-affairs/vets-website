                        <p><strong>You can sign in to VA.gov in 1 of 3 ways:</strong></p>

                        <p>Yes. You can verify your identity in person at your nearest VA regional office. If you’re a VA patient, you can also verify your identity in person at your local VA health care facility.</p>
                        <h4>Verifying your identity in person at a VA regional office</h4>
                        <p>You can verify your identity at your nearest VA regional office as part of the process of getting a Premium <strong>DS Logon</strong> account. You can then use this account to sign in to VA.gov without having to verify your identity online.</p>

                        <p>You can use a Premium <strong>My HealtheVet</strong> or Premium <strong>DS Logon</strong> account to sign in to VA.gov with a verified account. Because you already verified your identity when you got your premium account, you won’t need to verify your identity again on VA.gov.</p>
                        <h4>How to get a Premium DS Logon account</h4>
                        <p>Follow these 2 steps to sign up for a Premium <strong>DS Logon</strong> account.</p>
                        <p><strong>1. First, make sure you’re enrolled in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).</strong> This is the database that records all the people who are eligible for military benefits.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>If you’re a Veteran or Servicemember or qualified family caregiver, survivor, or dependent of a Veteran or Servicemember who served after 1982,</strong> you should already be enrolled in DEERS.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you’re a Veteran or the qualified family caregiver, survivor, or dependent of a Veteran who served before 1982,</strong> you may not be enrolled. To enroll, call us at <a href="tel:+1phonenumber">1-800-827-1000</a> and choose “Option 7.” Tell the operator you want to enroll in DEERS, and ask them to send you an email confirming when enrollment is complete.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>2. Then, register for your basic DS Logon account online.</strong></p>
                        <p>Go to the DS Logon self-service website and click on the <strong>More DS Logon Options</strong> button. From the choices that appear, select <strong>Need a DS Logon?</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>You’ll be asked to choose how you want to register:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>If you have a Common Access Card (CAC) with accessible card reader,</strong> select this option. It’s the easiest way to get a DS Logon account and upgrade to a premium account right away.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you have a Defense Finance and Account Service (DFAS) myPay account,</strong> you can select this option. You’ll be able to upgrade to a premium account right away.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you don’t have a CAC or DFAS myPay account,</strong> select the <strong>None of the above conditions apply</strong> option.</li>
                        </ul>
                           <p>The registration tool will walk you through the sign-up process for your account and will prompt you to upgrade to a premium account through an online proofing process. Through this process, you’ll be asked a series of questions to prove you’re you—and not someone pretending to be you—to help protect the personal information you’ll have access to with a premium account.</p>
                           <p><a href="https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/">Go to the DS Logon self-service website</a>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’d rather verify your identity and upgrade to a Premium <strong>DS Logon</strong> account in person or by phone, read the instructions in the section above on verifying your identity.</p>
                        <h4>How to get a Premium My HealtheVet account if you’re a VA patient</h4>
                        <p>Follow these 2 steps to sign up for a Premium <strong>My HealtheVet</strong> account.</p>
                        <p><strong>1. First, sign up for an account on the My HealtheVet website.</strong> You’ll need to have your Social Security number on hand. Be sure to choose <strong>VA Patient</strong> on the registration form. This will automatically upgrade your account to an advanced account, and then you can upgrade to a premium account.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-registration/">Sign up for a My HealtheVet account</a>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have a Premium <strong>DS Logon</strong> or ID.me account, you can skip step 1 above, and go right to step 2 to sign in to <strong>My HealtheVet</strong> with either of these accounts.
                        <p><strong>2. Then, upgrade to a premium account.</strong></p>
                        <p>You can do this in 1 of 2 ways.</p>
                        <h5>Upgrade your account using your Premium <strong>DS Logon</strong> or ID.me user ID and password</h5>
                        <p>To do this, sign in to <strong>My HealtheVet</strong> using your premium <strong>DS Logon</strong> or ID.me user ID and password.</p>
                        <p>Once signed in, select the <strong>Upgrade Now</strong> button at the top left side of the screen. Then, on the account upgrade page, check the box certifying that you’re the owner of the account and approve the request, and click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
