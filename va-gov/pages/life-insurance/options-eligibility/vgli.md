**At least one of these must be true. You:**

- Had part-time Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) as a member of the National Guard or Reserves, and you suffered an    injury or disability (damage to your body or mind that makes it hard for you to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work) while on duty—including direct traveling to and from duty—that disqualified you for standard premium insurance rates, **or**
- Had SGLI while you were in the military and you’re within 1 year and 120 days of being released from an active-duty period of 31 or more days, **or**
- Are within 1 year and 120 days of retiring or being released from the Ready Reserves or National Guard, **or**

### What life insurance benefits can I get with VGLI?

$10,000 to $400,000 in life insurance benefits, based on the amount of SGLI coverage you had when you left the military.

### Can I convert my VGLI policy into a commercial policy?

Yes. You can convert your policy into a commercial (civilian) policy at any time. You’ll be able to convert at standard premium rates, without having to provide proof that you’re in good health.

**To convert your VGLI policy:**

<ol class="process" markdown="1">

  <li class="process-step list-one">
  
  Choose your new insurance company. <br>
  [View our list of companies that take part in this program]( https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGL133_ed2016-06.pdf).
  
  </li>
  
  <li class="process-step list-two">
  
  Apply at the local sales office of your chosen company.
  
  </li>
  
  <li class="process-step list-three">
  
  Get a letter from OSGLI confirming that you have VGLI coverage (called a VGLI Conversion Notice) and give the letter to the agent who takes your application.
  
  </li>
</ol>

**Note:** The conversion policy must be a permanent policy, such as a whole life policy. You can’t convert to other types of policies, like term, variable life, or universal life insurance. And supplementary policy benefits, like Accidental Death and Dismemberment or Waiver of Premium for Disability, aren’t considered part of the conversion policy.

### Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance (VMLI)

If you have a severe service-connected disability that we’ve concluded was caused—or made worse—by your service, you may be able to get Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance (VMLI). In the event of your death, this mortgage protection insurance can help your family pay off the home mortgage on a home that’s been adapted to meet your needs.

To get VMLI, you’ll need to apply for our Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grant. The SAH grant can help you buy, build, or make changes (like installing ramps or widening doorways) to a home so you can live more independently. When you receive an SAH grant, your Loan Guaranty agent will tell you if you qualify for VMLI and will help you apply. <br>
[Find out if you qualify for an SAH grant—and how to apply](https://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/adaptedhousing.asp). <br>
