<h3>If you have new evidence or documentation to support your appeal</h3>
You can send this along with your form. Evidence may include documents like a doctor’s report, police report, or supporting statement from someone familiar with your condition or situation. 

<b>Be sure to:</b>
<ul>
<li>Check the box on the form that fits what your new evidence is supporting, and write a brief description of the evidence. Include information like the specific page number(s) where the new information appears in your medical record, or the specific date of a police report.</li>
<li>Highlight any new evidence in your medical records</li>
<li>Submit only the new evidence or documentation that supports your appeal. You don’t need to resend documents you sent before. If you send everything again, this will delay your appeal.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you’re filing an appeal as a guardian, power of attorney, or military trustee</h3>
You’ll need to include copies of the letters confirming your status, such as a guardianship, conservatorship, or Power of Attorney document. Not providing these documents will slow the process for your appeal.
