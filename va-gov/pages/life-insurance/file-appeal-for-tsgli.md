<h2 itemprop="name">Do I need to send anything else with the form?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You may need to send other documents with your form if either of these is true:

<h3>If you have new evidence or documents to support your appeal</h3>
Please send this in with your form. Evidence may include documents like a doctor’s report, police report, or supporting statement from someone familiar with your condition or situation.

<b>Be sure to point out what's new:</b>
<ul>
<li>Check the box on the form that describes what your new evidence supports, and write a brief description of the evidence. Include details like the specific page number(s) where the new information appears in your medical record, or the specific date of a police report.</li>
<li>Highlight any new evidence in your medical records.</li>
</ul>

<b>Please submit only the new evidence or documents that support your appeal.</b> If you resend documents we've already received from you, it'll delay your appeal.


<h3>If you’re filing an appeal as a guardian, power of attorney, or military trustee</h3>
You’ll need to include copies of the letters confirming your status, such as a guardianship, conservatorship, or Power of Attorney document. If you don't provide these documents, it'll slow the process for your appeal.
