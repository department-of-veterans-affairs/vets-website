<div class="va-introtext">

If you qualify for survivors pension benefits, the amount you get will be based on the difference between your countable income and a limit that Congress sets (called the Maximum Annual Pension Rate, or MAPR).

</div>

- **Your countable income** is how much you earn, including your salary, investment and retirement payments, and any income you may have from your dependents. Some expenses, like non-reimbursable medical expenses (paid medical expenses not covered by your insurance provider), may reduce your countable income.

- **Your MAPR amount** is the maximum amount of pension payable to a Veteran, surviving spouse, or child. Your MAPR is based on how many dependents you have and whether you qualify for Housebound or Aid and Attendance benefits. MAPRs are adjusted each year for cost-of-living increases. You can find your current MAPR amount using the tables below.

**Example:**
You’re a qualified surviving spouse with 1 dependent child. You also qualify for Aid and Attendance benefits. Your yearly income is $10,000.

Your MAPR amount = $16,837 <br>
Your yearly income = $10,000 <br>
Your VA pension = $6,837 for the year (or $569 paid each month)

### Find your Maximum Annual Pension Rate (MAPR) amount

*Date of Cost-of-Living Increase: December 1, 2017* <br>
*Increase Factor: 2%* <br>
*Standard Medicare Deduction: Actual amount will be determined by SSA based on individual income.*
