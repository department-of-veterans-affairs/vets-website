### Can I get disability benefits from VA?

You may be able to get disability benefits if you have symptoms related to a traumatic event (the “stressor”) or your experience with the stressor is related to the PTSD symptoms, and you meet all of the requirements listed below. 

**All of these must be true:**
- The stressor happened during your service, **and**
- You can’t function as well as you once could because of your symptoms, **and**
- A doctor has diagnosed you with PTSD

### What does VA consider to be a traumatic event?

We consider any of these to be a traumatic event:

- You suffered a serious injury, personal or sexual trauma, or sexual violation, **or** 
- You were threatened with injury, sexual assault, or death

<br>

### Who’s covered?

Veterans
</div>

### What kind of disability benefits can I get?

- Health care
- Compensation (payments)
- Treatment for PTSD

--------

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits. <br>
[Apply for disability benefits](/disability/how-to-file-claim/).

Please note that the screening process for disability benefits is geared toward getting a full understanding of your PTSD, not treating it. To get help or treatment, contact your health care provider or any of the emergency contacts listed at the top of this page.
