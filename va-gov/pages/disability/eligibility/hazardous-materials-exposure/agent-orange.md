<div class="va-introtext">

The U.S. military used Agent Orange to clear plants and trees during the Vietnam War. If you served in or near Vietnam during the Vietnam Era—or in certain related jobs—you may have had contact with this toxic chemical. Find out if you can get disability compensation or benefits for illnesses believed to be caused by Agent Orange.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I get disability benefits from VA?

You may be able to get disability benefits if both of the below descriptions are true for you.

**Both of these must be true:**
- You have an illness believed to be caused by Agent Orange, **and**
- You came into contact with Agent Orange while serving in the military

[See the list of Agent Orange‒related illnesses](/disability/eligibility/hazardous-materials-exposure/agent-orange/related-diseases/).


#### Who’s covered?

- Veterans
- Qualified dependents

</div>

### What kind of disability benefits can I get?

- Health care
- Compensation (payments)

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits and submit your evidence (supporting documents). 

**If you have an illness believed to be caused by Agent Orange,** you won’t need to show the problem started during—or got worse because of—your military service. This is because we believe that certain diseases are the result of exposure to herbicides. We refer to these as presumptive diseases. <br>
[See the list of Agent Orange‒related illnesses](/disability/eligibility/hazardous-materials-exposure/agent-orange/related-diseases/).

<div id="evidence-agent-orange" class="usa-accordion-content">
When you file your claim, you'll need to submit this evidence:
  
- A medical record that shows you have an Agent Orange‒related illness, **and**
- A military record that shows your service dates in Vietnam or in or near the Korean demilitarized zone, **and**
- Evidence that proves exposure to herbicides in a location other than Vietnam or the Korean demilitarized zone
