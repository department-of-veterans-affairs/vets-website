### Am I eligible for additional VA disability compensation for my dependent(s)?

You may be eligible for additional disability compensation for a spouse, child, and/or parent if you meet both of the requirements listed below. 

**Both of these must be true. You:**	

- Are eligible for VA disability compensation, **and**
- Have a combined disability rating of at least 30% <br>
<br>

### Who does VA consider a dependent?

**A dependent is:**

- A spouse (**Note:** we recognize same-sex and common-law marriages)
- A parent, if you’re directly caring for them and their income and net worth are below a certain amount
- An unmarried child (including an adopted child or stepchild) who meets one of the eligibility requirements listed below

**To be considered a dependent, one of these must be true of an unmarried child. They:**
- Are under 18 years old, **or**
- Are between the ages of 18 and 23 years old and enrolled in school full time, **or**
- Became permanently disabled before they turned 18

</div>

## When should I file a claim for additional disability compensation for a dependent?

This depends on where you are in the process of applying for disability compensation.

### If you haven’t applied yet for disability compensation

You may file a claim at the same time as you apply for disability compensation.

If you receive a combined disability rating of at least 30%, we’ll automatically consider your eligibility for additional disability compensation for your dependent. <br>

[Find out how to file a claim for disability compensation](/disability/how-to-file-claim/). 

### If you have one or more dependents, but you didn’t claim them when you originally applied for disability compensation 

If you have a combined disability rating of at least 30%, you may file your claim for additional disability compensation online.

### If something changes in your family status after you received a combined disability rating of at least 30%

You may file a claim for additional disability compensation online whenever you add a dependent.

**You can add a dependent if:**

- You get married 
- You have or adopt a child
- Your child is between 18 and 23 years old and enrolled in school full time
- We determine that your child, who is at least 18 years old, became permanently disabled before turning 18
- You become the caregiver for a parent whose income and net worth is below a certain amount

Yes, but we encourage you to file online. The online process is simple, and you can upload your supporting documents along with your claim.  

When you file your claim online, we recognize the day you start the online claim process as the date VA received your claim. This means that if we decide you’re eligible for additional disability compensation, we’ll pay you back to this date.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-apply-paid-back">Can I get paid back to the date my spouse and I got married, or the date when my child was born or adopted?</button>
<div id="questions-apply-paid-back" class="usa-accordion-content">

We may pay you back to the date of your marriage or the birth or adoption of your child if you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true. You:**
	
- Had already received a combined disability rating of at least 30% at the time of the marriage, birth, or adoption, **and**
- File your claim for additional disability compensation for the dependent within a year of the marriage, birth, or adoption, **and**
- Respond within a year to our request for any more information or evidence needed to confirm your claim <br>

If it’s been more than 1 year since you got married or had or adopted a child, we may not pay you back to the date of the marriage, birth, or adoption. Instead, we may pay you back only to the date we received your claim for additional disability for the dependent or, in some cases, up to a year before before this date.

You can check this through your eBenefits account.

Sign in to your account.

Then click the “Dependents” link under the “My Profile” section. 

If you see your dependent(s) listed there, you should be eligible for additional compensation for them. If they’re not listed, you should file a claim for the additional benefit. <br>

### Questions about adding or removing certain kinds of dependents

<ul class="usa-accordion">
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-specific-Veteran-spouse">What if my spouse is also a Veteran with a combined disability rating of at least 30%? Can we both receive additional disability compensation for each other and for our children? Or can only one of us receive the additional benefit?</button>
<div id="questions-specific-Veteran-spouse" class="usa-accordion-content">

If you and your spouse are both Veterans with a combined disability rating of at least 30%, you can both receive additional disability compensation for each other and for your children.

**You should know:** It’ll take us longer to process your claim if your spouse is also a Veteran. But if you file your claim online, and we decide you’re eligible for additional disability compensation for your dependent(s), we’ll pay you back to the date you started the online claim process.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-specific-divorce-remove">What happens if I get divorced or need to remove a dependent?</button>
<div id="questions-specific-divorce-remove" class="usa-accordion-content">
	
You can submit a request through eBenefits asking us to stop paying additional disability compensation for a spouse or child. We’ll need more time to process a request that involves a child than a request that involves a spouse, but the online process is still much faster than submitting a paper request.

**If you get divorced**, you’ll want to notify us right away. You don't need to send or upload supporting documents to eBenefits in this case. 

This will help to make sure we don’t continue paying you additional disability compensation for your former spouse and, if applicable, stepchildren after the divorce. If we continue paying you benefits that you’re not eligible for, we may withhold money from future payments until you’ve paid us back. <br>

<div id="questions-specific-child-school" class="usa-accordion-content">
 
You’ll need to update your child’s school information in eBenefits. 

Sign in to your account. 

Click “Add or Remove Dependents” (you'll find it under the “Apply” section on the homepage). 

Then select “Update Dependents.” <br>

<div id="questions-specific-child-old" class="usa-accordion-content">

No. We’ll track your child’s age based on the date of birth you give us when you submit your claim. When your child turns 18, we’ll stop paying additional disability compensation for them unless you let us know they’re enrolled in school full time.
