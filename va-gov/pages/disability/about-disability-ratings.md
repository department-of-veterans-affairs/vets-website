<div class="va-introtext">

For each disability claim, we assign a severity rating from 0% to 100% in 10% increments (for example, 10%, 20%, 30%). We base this rating on the evidence—supporting documents like a doctor’s report or medical test results—you give us as well as other information we may get from other sources like federal agencies. [File a claim now](/disability/how-to-file-claim/).

We use a Combined Ratings table to calculate disability percentage if you have more than 1 disability. <a href="https://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/rates-index.asp#combinedRatingsTable1" target="_blank">View the Combined Ratings table</a>

### How do ratings work for a disability I had before entering the service that got worse because of my service?

If you get disability benefits for a disability that you had before entering the military that got worse because of your service (called a preservice claim), the amount of compensation (monthly payments) you’ll get will be based on the level of aggravation, or how much worse your service made your disability.

For example, if you had an illness or injury (also known as a condition) that was 10% disabling when you entered the military, and it became 20% disabling due to service, then the level of aggravation would be 10%.

### Can I get increased payments if I have a severe disability or dependents?

You may be paid added amounts in certain instances if:

-	You have a very severe disability or loss of limb
-	You have a spouse, child, or dependent parent
-	You have a seriously disabled spouse
