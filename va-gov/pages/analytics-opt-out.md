        <p>This opt-out is will endure for this device/browser combination as long as you do not remove/reset your cookies. If you use multiple browsers or devices, you will need to opt out once for each device/browser combination to fully exclude yourself.</p>
        <p>The intended use case of this opt-out is for VA.gov team members performing testing or validation in the production environment with their personal devices. Other uses are not recommended. The only way to re-enable VA.gov Google Analytics collection is to clear the browser cookies. Therefore, this is not recommended for use on any shared devices.</p>
