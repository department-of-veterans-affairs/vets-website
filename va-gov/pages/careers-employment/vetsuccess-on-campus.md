<div class="va-introtext">

VetSuccess on Campus (VSOC) supports Veterans, Servicemembers, and some eligible dependents in their transition from military to college life. We have Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors (called VSOC Counselors) at 94 college campuses across the country.

### How our counselors can help you as a Veteran or Servicemember

Our counselors can help you with your Veterans’ benefits, which may include VA health services and education benefits. They can also show you how to get referrals for health services and disability accommodations (like help with taking notes or completing writing assignments) in the classroom. <br>
