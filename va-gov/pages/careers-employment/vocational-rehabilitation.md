If you have a service-connected disability that limits your ability to work or prevents you from working, the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) program—also referred to as Chapter 31—can help. Find out if you're eligible and how to apply for VR&E benefits and services, like help exploring employment options and any required training needs. In some cases, your family members may also be eligible for certain VR&E benefits.
