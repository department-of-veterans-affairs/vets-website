<div class="va-introtext">

If you want to follow an employment path that uses your existing skill set, the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) Rapid Access to Employment track can help you with your job search. We offer counseling and rehabilitation services that address your abilities, aptitudes, and interests.

Find out if you can get VR&amp;E benefits and services to help you use your existing skill set to find a job.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I get employment counseling and job-search support through VR&amp;E?

You may be eligible for these benefits if you’re a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability, and you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true. You:**
- Have an employment handicap or barrier, **and**
- Are enrolled in VR&E, **and**
- Already have experience, education, or training in your field of interest

**Note:** Having an employment handicap means your service-connected disability limits your ability to  prepare for, obtain, and maintain suitable employment (a job that doesn’t make your disability worse, is stable, and matches your abilities, aptitudes, and interests).

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

- Tools to help with your job search
- Vocational counseling
- Help with writing your resume and preparing for interviews
- Help determining if you’re eligible for Veterans’ Preference
