- [Co-op training](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/co-op-training/)
- [Non-college degree programs (technical or vocational courses)](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/non-college-degree-programs/)
- [Flight training](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/flight-training/)
- [On-the-job training and apprenticeships](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/on-the-job-training-apprenticeships/)

  - Deficiency courses (classes some student must take in order to be admitted to a certain college)
  - Refresher courses (brief courses that help people review and improve their knowledge in a certain subject area)

How much you put in every month will determine how many months of benefits you get (1–36 months). You have 10 years from your release from active duty to use VEAP benefits. If VEAP benefits go unused after that 10-year period, you can ask for a refund for the amount left in your fund.

**Active Duty:**
If you’re currently on active duty and want to use VEAP, you must have at least 3 months of contributions in the fund.

**Withdrawals:**
You can withdraw the money in your VEAP account if you don’t meet basic qualifying requirements or if you formally ask for a refund.
