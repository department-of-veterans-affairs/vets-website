The GI Bill covers more than just tuition. We may pay you back for the cost of certain tests you need to take to become a licensed or certified professional—or to apply for college or a training course. Only tests approved for the GI Bill are covered under this benefit, so find out what’s approved before you take any tests.

**What you should know about test benefits. We:**
- Will pay for tests for as many different covered licenses or certifications as you'd like.
- Will pay for tests even if you don't score high enough to get your license or certification. You can take the same test as many times as you need.
- Won't pay for fees or costs related to getting the actual license or certification document.

For tests taken before August 1, 2018, if we paid you back for testing under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, we charged you at least a month of entitlement pay. For licensing and certification tests taken after August 1, 2018, we'll prorate the entitlement charges under the Post-9/11 GI Bill based on the actual amount of the fee charged for the test.
