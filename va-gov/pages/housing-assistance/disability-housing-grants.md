We offer grants to Veterans and Servicemembers with certain service-connected disabilities so they can buy or change a home to meet their needs and live more independently. Changing a home might involve installing ramps or widening doorways. Find out if you can get a grant to help meet your housing needs.

## Can I get a Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant—and how much funding does this grant offer?

You may be able to get an SAH grant if you’re using the grant money to buy, build, or change your permanent home (a home you plan to live in for a long time) and you meet both of the requirements listed below.

**Both of these must be true. You:**
- Own or will own the home, **and**
- Have a qualifying service-connected disability

**Qualifying service-connected disabilities include:**
- The loss or loss of use of more than one limb
- The loss or loss of use of a lower leg along with the residuals (lasting effects) of an organic (natural) disease or injury
- Blindness in both eyes (having only light perception) along with the loss or loss of use of a leg
- Certain severe burns
- The loss or loss of use of one or both lower extremities (feet or legs) after September 11, 2001, that makes it so you can’t balance or walk without the help of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair <br>
**Please note:** We can only give this grant to 30 Veterans and Servicemembers each fiscal year (FY). We've already given out all of the available grants for 2018. If you qualify for but don't receive a grant in 2018 because the cap was reached, you may be able to use this benefit in FY 2019 or future years if the law continues to give us the authority to offer these grants and we don't go beyond the new FY cap.

For FY 2018, you may be able to get up to 3 grants—for a total of up to $81,080—through the SAH grant program.

**Both of these must be true:**

### What if I need money to make changes to a family member’s home that I’m living in for a short period of time?
