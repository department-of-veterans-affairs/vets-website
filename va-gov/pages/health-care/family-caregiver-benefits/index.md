### TRICARE

If you’re the family member of an active-duty, retired, or deceased Servicemember, National Guard Soldier, Reservist, or Medal of Honor recipient, you may qualify for the TRICARE program.

TRICARE provides comprehensive health coverage, including health plans, prescription medicines, dental plans, and programs for people with special needs. The Department of Defense’s Defense Health Agency manages this program. <br>

### The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA)

Are you the current or surviving spouse or child of a Veteran with disabilities or a Veteran who has died? If you don’t qualify for TRICARE, you may be able to get health insurance through CHAMPVA. Through this program, we cover the cost of some of your health care services and supplies. This is called cost sharing. <br>

### The Program of Comprehensive Assistance to Family Caregivers of Post-9/11 Veterans

If you’re a family member caring for a Veteran with disabilities who was injured in the line of duty on or after September 11, 2001, you may qualify for health care benefits and other caregiver support through the Program of Comprehensive Assistance to Family Caregivers. <br>

### The Camp Lejeune Family Member Program
Did you live at U.S. Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune or Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) in North Carolina with an active-duty Veteran who was your spouse or parent? If you lived in either of these places for at least 30 cumulative days from August 1953 through December 1987, you may have had contact with contaminants in the drinking water there. Scientific and medical evidence has shown an association between exposure to these contaminants and the development of certain diseases later on.
If you now have one of the related conditions, you may qualify for health care benefits through VA. <br>
