<div class="va-introtext">

Are you the spouse or surviving spouse of—or a child of—a Veteran with disabilities or a Veteran who has died? If you don’t qualify for TRICARE (the Department of Defense’s health care program for active-duty and retired Servicemembers and their families), you may be able to get health insurance through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA).

Through this program, we cover the cost of some of your health care services and supplies. This is called cost sharing. Find out if you qualify for CHAMPVA and how to apply.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown=“1”>

### Can I get health care through CHAMPVA?

You can only get health care through CHAMPVA if you don’t qualify for TRICARE and at least one of the descriptions below is true for you.

**At least one of these must be true. You’re:**

* The spouse or child of a Veteran who’s been rated permanently and totally disabled for a service-connected disability by a VA regional benefit office, **or**
* The surviving spouse or child of a Veteran who died from a VA-rated service-connected disability, **or**
* The surviving spouse or child of a Veteran who was at the time of death rated permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected disability, **or**
* The surviving spouse or child of a Servicemember who died in the line of duty, not due to misconduct (in most of these cases, family members qualify for TRICARE, not CHAMPVA).

A service-connected disability is a disability that we’ve concluded was caused—or made worse—by the Veteran’s active-duty service. A permanent disability is one that's not expected to improve.

**Note:** A Veteran who’s the qualifying CHAMPVA sponsor for their family may also qualify for the VA health care program based on their own Veteran status. If 2 spouses are both Veterans who qualify as CHAMPVA sponsors for their family, they both may now qualify for CHAMPVA benefits. Each time they need medical care, they may choose to get care through the VA health care program or using their CHAMPVA coverage.

### What else might affect whether I can get CHAMPVA benefits for myself or a family member?

There are other factors that may affect whether you or other family members qualify for CHAMPVA. Please click on the description that matches your status to learn more:

### How do I get CHAMPVA benefits?

You’ll need to apply for these benefits.

**To apply, submit these required documents:**

- [Application for CHAMPVA Benefits (VA Form 10-10d)]( https://www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/vha-10-10d-fill.pdf), **and** 
- [Other Health Insurance Certification (VA Form 10-7959c)](http://www.va.gov/vaforms/form_detail.asp?FormNo=7959c), **and**
- Documents related to your Medicare status:
  - **If you qualify for Medicare for any reason,** you’ll need to submit a copy of your Medicare card. 
  - **If you’re 65 years old or older and don’t qualify for Medicare,** you’ll need to send us documentation from the Social Security Administration that confirms you don't qualify for Medicare benefits under anyone’s Social Security number.

**To speed up the processing of your application, you can also send copies (*not* originals) of these optional documents:**
- The page from the VBA rating decision showing your Veteran is permanently and totally disabled (or the death rating if you're a survivor)
- Your Veteran's DD214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty)—or, if the Veteran was a World War II or Korean War Veteran, the Report of Separation. If you don’t have a copy of the necessary form, you can request it by submitting a Standard Form 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, from the National Archives.<br>
[Find out how to request military service records online, by mail, or by fax](https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records).

**If you’re a surviving spouse who remarried but is once again single,** also send a copy of the legal document that ended your marriage. This may be a divorce decree, death certificate, or annulment decree.

Be sure to sign and date your application. If your Veteran is applying for you as a spouse, be sure to also include the date of the marriage on the application.
