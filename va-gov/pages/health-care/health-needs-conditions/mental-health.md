## Getting Started 

If you need support for a specific mental health problem—or if you're having problems sleeping, controlling your anger, or readjusting to civilian life—you are not alone. And we can help. 

Over 1.7 million Veterans received mental health services at VA last year. Our services range from peer support with other Veterans to counseling, therapy, medication or a combination of these options. Our goal is to help you take charge of your treatment and live a full and meaningful life. 

### How do I schedule my first appointment?

**If you're already using VA medical services,** ask your primary care provider to arrange for you to see a VA mental health provider.

**If you're not already using VA medical services,** contact your nearest VA medical center (VAMC) or Vet Center to talk about your needs. <br>
[Find your nearest VA medical center or Vet Center](/facilities/?zoomLevel=4&page=1&facilityType=health). 

### What if I'm not sure what kind of help I need?

You can call 1-877-222-VETS (<a href="tel:+18002228387">1-877-222-8387</a>) to find the right resource for your needs. If you have hearing loss, call TTY: <a href="tel:+18008778339">1-800-877-8339</a>. 

We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. (ET)

### It's hard for me to get to a VA facility in person. Can I get mental health services online?

Yes. You may be able to use one or more of the virtual options listed below.

- **The Veteran Training online self-help portal for overcoming everyday challenges:** You can use this portal's tools to work on problem-solving skills, manage anger, develop parenting skills, and more. The tools are based on proven mental health practices that have successfully helped other Veterans and families. The portal is free, and you don't have to sign in or provide any personal information to use the tools.<br>
[Visit the Veteran Training portal](www.veterantraining.va.gov).

- **Smartphone apps for Veterans:** We've partnered with the Department of Defense (DoD) to create free smartphone applications you can use to help manage your physical and mental health. These include apps to help you deal with stress, quit smoking, and more.<br>
[Learn more about apps for Veterans](http://ncgwg.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Resources_-Apps-for-Veterans.pdf).

- **The VA Telemental Health program:** You can connect with a VA mental health provider through a computer or mobile device in your home or at a local VA health facility. If you're enrolled in VA health care, ask any of your providers to help connect you with our telemental health program.

### Can I speak to a fellow Veteran who's been through this before?

Yes. The **BeThere** peer assistance line and outreach center offers support for all Veterans and Servicemembers (including National Guard Soldiers and Reservists) and their families. You can talk privately with peer coaches who are Veterans, Servicemembers, or military spouses. 

**To talk with a peer coach:**

- [Start an online chat](https://www.betherepeersupport.org/).
- Call 1-844-357-PEER (<a href="tel:+18443577337">1-844-357-7337</a>)
- Text to <a href="tel:+14803606188">1-480-360-6188</a>

<br>

### What other options do I have?

**If you're a combat Veteran,** you can visit one of our Vet Centers to get free individual and group counseling for you and your family. You can access these services even if you're not enrolled in VA health care and aren't receiving disability compensation.

**Vet Centers offer services such as:**
- Military sexual trauma (MST) counseling
- Readjustment counseling
- Bereavement (grief) counseling
- Employment counseling
- Substance abuse assessment and referral

**If you'd like to connect with other Veterans, families, and local services,** you can visit our Make the Connection website. This site connects millions of Veterans, and their family members and friends, to local VA and community mental health resources.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-risk">Will using mental health services at VA put my career at risk?</button>
<div id="questions-risk" class="usa-accordion-content">
	
A mental health diagnosis or seeking mental health care doesn't automatically put work-related credentials such as security clearances at risk. Most employers recognize that healthy employees who get help when they need it are more productive and effective in their jobs than those who aren't performing at their best because they're not feeling well.
