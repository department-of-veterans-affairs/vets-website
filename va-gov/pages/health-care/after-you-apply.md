<div class="va-introtext">

After you’ve applied for VA health care, we’ll send you a letter in the mail to let you know if your application has been approved. Find out when to expect your letter—and what to do next.

</div>

### When will I hear back about my application?

<div class="card information" markdown="0">
<span class="number">In less than 1 week</span>
<span class="description">If more than a week has passed since you gave us your application and you haven’t heard back, please don’t apply again. Call our toll-free hotline at 1-877-222-VETS (<a href="tel:+18772228387">1-877-222-8387)</a>.</span>

</div>

### If you approve my application, what do I do next?

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

**Wait for your welcome call from VA.** We’ll call you to welcome you to the VA health care program, help you with scheduling your first doctor’s appointment, and answer any questions you may have about your health care benefits.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

**Read your Veterans Health Benefits Handbook.** We’ll send this to you by mail. Your handbook will explain your specific health care benefits (based on the priority group we assigned you), how much you’ll pay in copays, and other helpful information. <br />
[Download a sample handbook](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhbh/publications/vhbh_sample_handbook_2014.pdf). <br />
[Learn more about priority groups](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/resources/priority_groups.asp).

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

**Get your Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC).** This is the card you’ll use for ID and to check in at your VA health care appointments. To get your card, contact your local VA medical center and speak with the enrollment coordinator. Ask the coordinator to help you arrange to have your picture taken for your new VHIC. Or, you can request your VHIC at your next VA health care appointment. <br /> [Learn more about the VHIC](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/vhic/index.asp). <br />

</li>

<li class="process-step list-four">

**Go to your first VA doctor’s appointment.** You may have requested a doctor’s appointment when you applied (either in person or on your application). If you did, we’ll set up an appointment for you with a VA doctor or provider and send you a notice with your appointment time in the mail. If you didn’t ask for a doctor’s appointment when you applied, we’ll help you set up your appointment during your welcome call.

<span id="after-removed-enrollment">

#### What should I do if I'm already enrolled in VA health care, but I just got a letter saying VA has determined I’m not eligible and will be removed from enrollment?

First, you’ll want to gather any evidence to support your eligibility to stay enrolled in VA health care and send it to us. Evidence may include documents like doctor’s reports, medical tests, or military service records. You’ll have 60 days from the date you received your letter to send us this evidence before we make our final decision.

During these 60 days, you’ll keep and can continue to use your VA health care benefits.

If we decide not to keep you enrolled in VA health care after this time, you have the right to appeal our decision.<br>

<span id="after-cancel-enrollment">

#### How do I cancel my VA health care enrollment if I no longer want or need it?

You can cancel, or decline, enrollment at any time. Just submit a signed and dated document (like a letter) telling us that you want to cancel your coverage. You can bring your document to a VA medical center or mail it to this address:

<b>Note</b>: Canceling your enrollment in VA health care may impact your health care coverage requirements under the Affordable Care Act if you don’t have other health care.

You may reapply at any time. But please note that we’ll consider you a new applicant when you reapply. We’ll base your eligibility on the eligibility requirements at that time.
