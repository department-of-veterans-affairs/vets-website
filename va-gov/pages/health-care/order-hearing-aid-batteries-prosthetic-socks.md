<h2 itemprop="name">How long will it take my items to arrive, and when should I reorder?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">

### For hearing aid batteries
Your batteries should arrive within 7-10 days.

Each order should have enough batteries to last for about 6 months. To make sure you have new batteries in time, you’ll want to reorder when you have enough batteries left for about 30 days.

### For prosthetic socks
Your order time will depend on whether we have the socks you need in stock or need to get more from the vendor.

To make sure you have your socks in time, you’ll want to place your order about 30 days before you need them.
