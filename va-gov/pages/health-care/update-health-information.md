<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">

<h2 itemprop="name">Why does this form ask about my other insurance?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

We ask for this information because we have to bill your private health insurance provider for any care, supplies, or medicine we provide to treat your non-service-connected conditions (illnesses or injuries that aren’t related to your military service).

We don’t bill Medicare or Medicaid, but we may bill Medicare supplemental health insurance for covered services.

If you have other health insurance coverage, it doesn’t affect the VA health care benefits you can get. And telling us about your other insurance may help to offset your costs.<br>
