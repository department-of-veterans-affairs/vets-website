<h2 itemprop="name">Can I refill and track all my VA prescriptions with this tool?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text"> 

You can use this tool to refill and track most VA prescriptions, including:
- VA medicines that were refilled or renewed
- Wound care supplies
- Diabetic supplies
- Other products and supplies sent through the VA Mail Order Pharmacy

Your VA health care team may decide not to ship medicines that you need right away, medicines that are not commonly prescribed, or those that require you to be closely monitored. In these cases, you’ll need to pick up your prescription from the VA health facility where you get care.

You can’t refill some medicines, like certain pain medicines and narcotics. You’ll need to get a new prescription from your VA provider each time you need more of these medicines.

<h2 itemprop="name">Where will VA send my prescriptions?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text"> 

Our mail order pharmacy will send your prescriptions to the address we have on file for you. We ship to all addresses in the United States and its territories. We don’t ship prescriptions to any foreign countries. 

**Important note:** Changing your address within My Health*e*Vet does **not** change your address for prescription shipments. If you change your address, please contact the VA health facility where you get care to update your file. <br>

<h2 itemprop="name">How long will my prescriptions take to arrive, and when should I reorder?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text"> 

Prescriptions usually arrive within 3 to 5 days. But you’ll be able to find specific information about your order on the website of the delivery service shown in your Rx Tracker.

To make sure you have your medicine in time, you’ll want to request your refill at least 10 days before you’ll run out of your current prescription.
