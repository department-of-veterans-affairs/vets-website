<div id="prescription-all" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
  <h2 itemprop="name">Can I refill and track all my VA prescriptions with this tool?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">  

You can use this tool to refill and track most VA prescriptions, including:
- VA medicines that were refilled or renewed
- Wound care supplies
- Diabetic supplies
- Other products and supplies sent through the VA Mail Order Pharmacy

Your VA health care team may decide not to ship medicines that you need right away, medicines that are not commonly prescribed, or those that require you to be closely monitored. In these cases, you’ll need to pick up your prescription from the VA health facility where you get care.

You can’t refill some medicines, like certain pain medicines and narcotics. You’ll need to get a new prescription from your VA provider each time you need more of these medicines.

<h2 itemprop="name">Where will VA send my prescriptions?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">  

Our mail order pharmacy will send your prescriptions to the address we have on file for you. We ship to all addresses in the United States and its territories. We don’t ship prescriptions to any foreign countries. 

**Important note:** Changing your address on Va.gov or My HealtheVet does not change your address for prescription shipments. If you change your address, please contact the VA health facility where you get care to update your file.

<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">    

Prescriptions usually arrive within 3 to 5 days. But you’ll be able to find specific information about your order on the website of the delivery service shown in your Rx Tracker.

**Note:** To make sure you have your medicine in time, you’ll want to request your refill at least 10 days before you’ll run out of your current prescription.

Yes. Va.gov and My HealtheVet are secure websites. We follow strict security policies and practices to protect your personal health information.

If you print or download anything from the website (like prescription details), you’ll need to take responsibility for protecting that information. 

Protect this information the same way you’d protect your banking or credit card information.

Don’t:
- Leave printouts with personal information on a printer
- Save your personal information to a public computer 
- Send an email that contains personal information
