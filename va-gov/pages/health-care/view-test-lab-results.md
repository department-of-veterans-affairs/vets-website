**Both of these must be true. You're:**
- Enrolled in VA health care, **and**
- Registered as a patient at a VA health facility

[Find out how to apply for VA health care](/health-care/how-to-apply/).

**And you must have one of these free accounts:**
- A premium **My Health<em>e</em>Vet** account, **or**
- A **DS Logon** account (used for eBenefits and milConnect), **or**
- A verified **ID.me** account that you can create here on VA.gov

<h2 itemprop="name">Can I view all my VA lab and test information using this tool?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text"> 

At this time, you can view only your VA chemistry/hematology results. These include tests for blood sugar, liver function, or blood cell counts. We’ll add more VA labs and tests in the future.

<h2 itemprop="name">Can I view results from non-VA providers or labs?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">

No. But you can enter this information yourself to keep all your results in one place.

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">

<h2 itemprop="name">Once I'm signed in within My Health<em>e</em>Vet, how do I view my results?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text"> 

On your welcome page dashboard, you’ll see a module for “Health Records.” Within that module, click on “Labs and Tests.” 
 
This will take you to a new page with links to view test results. If you’re signed in with a verified account, you’ll see:
- **VA chemistry/hematology results:** Your tests will be listed by date and specimen. A specimen is the sample studied by the test (like blood, urine, a tissue biopsy, or a throat swab). You can click on each to view details from your VA medical record.
- **Test results you've entered yourself:** You can add and view results from non-VA providers and labs. 

**Note:** If you’re signed in with an unverified account, you’ll see only the test results you've entered yourself.
