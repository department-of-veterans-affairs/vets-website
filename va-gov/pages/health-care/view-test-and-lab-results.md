<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">

<h2 itemprop="name">Once I'm signed in within My HealtheVet, how do I view my results?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

On your Welcome page dashboard, you’ll see a module for “Health Records.” Within that module, click on “Labs and Tests.”

This will take you to a new page with links to view test results.

**If you’re signed in with a Premium account, you’ll see:**
- **VA chemistry/hematology results:** Your tests will be listed by date and specimen. A specimen is the sample studied by the test (like blood, urine, a tissue biopsy, or a throat swab). You can click on each to view details from your VA medical record.
- **Test results you've entered yourself:** You can add and view results from non-VA providers and labs.

**Note:** If you’re signed in with a Basic or Advanced account, you’ll see only the test results you've entered yourself. <br>
