<h2 itemprop="name">Am I eligible to use this tool?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You can use this tool to view your VA results and information you enter yourself if you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**Both of these must be true. You're:**
- Enrolled in VA health care, **and**
- Registered as a patient at a VA health facility

[Find out how to apply for VA health care](/health-care/how-to-apply/).

**And you must have one of these free accounts:**
- A premium **My HealtheVet** account, **or**
- A **DS Logon** account (used for eBenefits and milConnect), **or**
- A verified **ID.me** account that you can create here on VA.gov

**Note:** If you use DS Logon, you'll need to verify your identity online as part of our sign-in process.

Please see the blue sign-in module above to learn more about signing in, creating or upgrading an account, and verifying your identity.

If you sign in with an unverified account, you’ll see only the results you've entered yourself.

<h2 itemprop="name">Can I view all my VA lab and test information using this tool?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

At this time, you can view only your VA chemistry/hematology results. These include tests for blood sugar, liver function, or blood cell counts. We’ll add more VA labs and tests in the future.

<h2 itemprop="name">Can I view results from non-VA providers or labs?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

No. But you can enter this information yourself to keep all your results in one place.

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">

<h2 itemprop="name">Once I'm signed in within My HealtheVet, how do I view my results?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

On your welcome page dashboard, you’ll see a module for “Health Records.” Within that module, click on “Labs and Tests.”

This will take you to a new page with links to view test results. If you’re signed in with a verified account, you’ll see:
- **VA chemistry/hematology results:** Your tests will be listed by date and specimen. A specimen is the sample studied by the test (like blood, urine, a tissue biopsy, or a throat swab). You can click on each to view details from your VA medical record.
- **Test results you've entered yourself:** You can add and view results from non-VA providers and labs.

**Note:** If you’re signed in with an unverified account, you’ll see only the test results you've entered yourself.
