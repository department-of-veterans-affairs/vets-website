## More About the Veterans Health Information Exchange

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">

<h3 itemprop="name">What is the Veterans Health Information Exchange, and how can it help me manage my health care?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

The Veterans Health Information Exchange (also called the “Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record” or VLER) is a program that lets us share Veteran health information electronically with non-VA community health care providers who are part of our approved trust network.

**This can help to:**
- Keep your personal health information more secure
- Improve your care by helping your providers make more informed decisions
- Keep you safe by making sure your providers have up-to-date information, like your current medications and allergies
- Save you time and money
- Improve how your VA and non-VA providers coordinate your care

This program is completely voluntary. You decide if we can share your information, and who we can share it with. And you can update your preferences as your needs change.
