- Give your health provider updates on your condition
- Request VA referral, test results, and prescription renewals
- Manage your VA appointments
- Ask routine administrative questions about topics like scheduling appointments
- Get health education information from the Veterans Health Library

  <h2 itemprop="name">How does secure messaging work on My Health<em>e</em>Vet?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">  

Secure messaging works a lot like email. 
 
You’ll sign into your account on our My Health*e*Vet web portal and access your secure messaging folder through your account dashboard. There, you can write messages, save drafts, review your sent messages, and keep a record of your conversations. 
 
You can use secure messaging to communicate with any VA health care team member who has signed up to participate.
 
You can send non-urgent, non-emergency messages any time of the day or night. Your VA health care team should respond within 3 business days (Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. except federal holidays). If you’d like, you can set your account up to notify  your personal email when you receive a new secure message.

<h2 itemprop="name">Can I use secure messaging for medical emergencies or urgent needs?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">  

No. You may not receive a reply for a few days with secure messaging.
 
If you think you have a medical emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room. 
 
If you don’t have an emergency, but you’re not sure what type of care you need, call your nearest VA health facility.
[Find your nearest VA health facility](/facilities/).
 
If you need to talk with someone right away, contact the Veterans Crisis Line. Whatever you’re struggling with—chronic pain, anxiety, depression, trouble sleeping, anger, or even homelessness—we can support you. Our Veterans Crisis Line is confidential (private), free, and available 24/7.

To connect with a Veterans Crisis Line responder any time day or night:

<div id="messaging-protected" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h2 itemprop="name">Will my information be protected when I use secure messaging?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text"> 
  
Yes. Va.gov and My Health*e*Vet are secure websites. We follow strict security policies and practices to protect your personal health information. And only your VA health care team will have access to your secure messages. 

If you print or download anything from the website (like prescription details), you’ll need to take responsibility for protecting that information. 

Protect this information the same way you’d protect your banking or credit card information. Don’t:
- Leave printouts with personal information on a printer
- Save your personal information to a public computer 
- Send an email that contains personal information
