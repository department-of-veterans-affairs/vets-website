<h2 itemprop="name">How does Secure Messaging work within My HealtheVet?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You’ll sign in to your account and access your Secure Messaging folder through your account Welcome page dashboard. There, you can write messages, save drafts, review your sent messages, and keep a record of your conversations.

You can use Secure Messaging to communicate with any VA health care team member who has signed up to participate.

You can send non-urgent, non-emergency messages at any time of the day or night. Your VA health care team should respond within 3 business days (Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., except federal holidays). If you’d like, you can set up your account to send a notification to your personal email when you receive a new secure message.

<h2 itemprop="name">Can I use Secure Messaging for medical emergencies or urgent needs?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

No. You shouldn't use Secure Messaging when you have an urgent need, because it may take a few days for you to get a reply.

**If you think you have a medical emergency,** call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.

**If you don’t have an emergency, but you’re not sure what type of care you need,** call your nearest VA health facility.<br>
[Find your nearest VA health facility](/facilities/).

**If you need to talk with someone right away,** contact the Veterans Crisis Line. Whatever you’re struggling with—chronic pain, anxiety, depression, trouble sleeping, anger, or even homelessness—we can support you. Our Veterans Crisis Line is confidential (private), free, and available 24/7.
