### Can I get allowances to help pay for a Veteran's burial and funeral costs?

You may be able to get burial allowances if you're paying for the burial and funeral costs, and if any of the below relationships or professional roles describes your connection to the Veteran.

**One of these must describe your relationship or role. You’re:**

- The Veteran’s surviving spouse (**Note:** we recognize same-sex marriages), **or**
- A surviving child of the Veteran, **or**
- A parent of the Veteran, **or**
- The executor or administrator of the Veteran’s estate (someone who officially represents the Veteran)

<br>

To get this benefit, the Veteran must not have received a dishonorable discharge, and one of the below circumstances must be true.

**One of these must be true of the Veteran. They:**

- Died as a result of a service-connected disability (a disability related to service), **or**
- Had been getting a VA pension or compensation when they died, **or**
- Had chosen to get military retired pay instead of compensation, **or**
- Died while getting VA care, either at a VA facility or at a facility contracted by VA, **or**

There's no time limit to file for a service-connected burial, plot, or interment allowance.
