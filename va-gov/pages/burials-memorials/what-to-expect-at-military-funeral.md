## What happens during a military funeral for a Veteran or Servicemember?

There may be a brief ceremony, including any readings or military honors, led by someone of the family's choice. This ceremony will take place at a special area called a committal shelter (not at the gravesite). A cemetery official will be there to help guide guests and family members.

The family may also choose to have military funeral honors performed during the ceremony. 

**Military funeral honors include:**
- The playing of “Taps”
- A rifle detail
- A color guard
- Uniformed Servicemembers who present the burial flag

**Note:** If you requested a headstone, marker, or medallion, we’ll arrange for it to be delivered within 60 days. <br>

## What else should I know about military funeral etiquette?

**People attending a military funeral may:**
- Bring flowers, which may go with the casket or urn when it’s taken from the committal shelter to the gravesite, **and**
- Visit the gravesite at the end of the workday, but not immediately following the ceremony
