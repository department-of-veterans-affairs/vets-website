## How do I get a flag?

To get a burial flag, fill out the Application for United States Flag for Burial Purposes (VA Form 27-2008). <br>
[Download VA Form 27-2008](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-27-2008-ARE.pdf).

Bring the application form to:
- A funeral director, **or**
- [A VA regional benefit office](http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/offices.asp), **or**
- A United States post office. Call ahead to make sure your local post office has burial flags.

## How do I display and care for the flag?

To protect the flag from weather damage, don’t leave it outside for long periods of time. <br>
[Find out how to display and fold the flag]( https://www.legion.org/flag/questions-answers/91522/how-flag-be-displayed-fully-open-or-half-open-casket).

The Veteran’s family can also donate the flag to a national cemetery that has an Avenue of Flags so that it can be flown on patriotic holidays.

We can’t replace flags that are lost, destroyed, or stolen, but some Veterans organizations may be able to help if something happens to the flag we gave you.
