[Find out how to display and fold the flag]( https://www.legion.org/flag/questions-answers/91522/how-flag-be-displayed-fully-open-or-half-open-casket).

The Veteran’s family can also donate the flag to a national cemetery that has an Avenue of Flags so that it can be flown on patriotic holidays.

We can’t replace flags that are lost, destroyed, or stolen, but some Veterans organizations may be able to help if something happens to the flag we gave you.
