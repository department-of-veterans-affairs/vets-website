You may be able to get compensation as a surviving spouse if you meet the requirements listed below. You'll also need to provide evidence with your claim showing that one of the descriptions below is true for the Veteran or Servicemember. Evidence may include documents like military service records, doctor's reports, and medical test results.

**One of these must be true. You:**
- Married the Veteran or Servicemember before January 1, 1957, **or**
- Married the Veteran or Servicemember within 15 years of their discharge from the period of military service during which the illness or injury that caused their death started or got worse, **or**

- Had a child with the Veteran or Servicemember, aren’t currently remarried, and either lived with the Veteran or Servicemember without a break until their death or, if separated, weren’t at fault for the separation

**Note:** If you remarried on or after December 16, 2003, and you were 57 years of age or older at the time you remarried, you can still continue to receive compensation.

**You'll also need to provide evidence showing that one of these descriptions is true for the Veteran or Servicemember:**
- The Servicemember died while on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive-duty training, **or**
- The Veteran died from a service-connected illness or injury, **or**
- The Veteran didn’t die from a service-connected illness or injury, but was eligible to receive VA compensation for a service-connected disability rated as totally disabling for a certain period of time

**If the Veteran's eligibility was due to a rating of totally disabling, they must have had this rating:**
- For at least 10 years before their death, **or**
- Since their release from active duty and for at least 5 years immediately before their death, **or**
- For at least 1 year before their death if they were a former Prisoner of War who died after September 30, 1999

**Note:** “Totally disabling” means the Veteran’s injuries made it impossible for them to work.
