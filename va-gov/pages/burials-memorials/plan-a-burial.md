## How do I plan a burial for a Veteran or other family member?

### If you have a pre-need decision letter confirming that the Veteran, spouse, or dependent family member can be buried in a VA national cemetery:

To start, you may want to choose a funeral director to help you plan the burial. Then either you or the funeral director can call the National Cemetery Scheduling Office at <a href="tel:+18005351117">1-800-535-1117</a> to request a burial.

You don’t need to do anything else except prepare yourself and your family for the funeral. <br>
