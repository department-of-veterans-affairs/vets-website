The Veterans Employment Center™ (VEC) provides support for your company during your search for Veteran candidates and after you have hired a Veteran or military family member. You can also make a hiring commitment as a first step in supporting Veterans and their families.

Research shows that hiring Veterans is good business, particularly when it comes to entrepreneurship, resiliency, mission strategy, and team-related goals and actions. The highly regarded Institute for Veterans and Military Families released a [brief](http://vets.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/TheBusinessCase7.14.pdf) titled “The Business Case for Hiring a Veteran: Beyond the Clichés” that lays out how Veterans tap into the skills learned during their time in service to add value to dynamic business environments. 

There are incentives such as the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) that ranges from $1,200 to $9,600, the [Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment program](http://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/index.asp), and [On-the-Job Training programs](/employment/employers/apprenticeship/). The [Compensated Work Therapy program](http://www.va.gov/health/cwt/) may also suit your company’s needs.  Some cities have a [Veterans Economic Community Initiative (VECI)](/employment/job-seekers/veci/) liaison who can help you connect with Veterans and understand their needs.
