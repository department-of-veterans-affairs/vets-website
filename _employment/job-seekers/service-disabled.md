As a service-disabled Veteran, there are many ways for you to pursue your personal and professional goals through both government and private-sector employment.

**Federal Job Preference**

If you are a service-disabled Veteran, you qualify for hiring preference when competing for certain federal jobs. Learn more about [applying for federal jobs](/veterans-employment-center/job-resources-federal-employment). Some classifications, or exceptions, may qualify you for specific federal positions. Know which hiring exceptions you qualify for as a service-disabled Veteran. Check [federal hiring authority information](http://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/shav/) before applying.

**Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E)**
If you are service disabled at more than 10% and can no longer continue your current employment due to injuries, you may be eligible for [Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E)](/_dummy-placeholder.html). 

**Start or Grow Your Own Business**
If entrepreneurship interests you, your disability may qualify you for preference in winning government contracts. VA and other [Veteran entrepreneur programs](/veterans-employment-center/job-resources-small-business) can support you through this journey. 

**Private Sector**

Private-sector employers may qualify for incentives such as [tax benefits](/employment/employers/)  when hiring service-disabled Veterans. Make sure you’re knowledgeable about this when you meet with [VA Employment Center](/employment/job-seekers/one-on-one/) representatives and during the interview process.

Credentialing and job training will help in your search. Check your [military transcripts](/veterans-employment-center/job-resources-military-transcripts) now to be sure they are accurate.

**Learn more**
Contact your local [Veteran Employment Specialist (VES)](http://vaforvets.va.gov/hr/RVECS/pages/rvecs-map.asp) or your [policy and benefits advocate](/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/help/) for more information.
