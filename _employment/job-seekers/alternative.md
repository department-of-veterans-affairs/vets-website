There are many ways for you to launch your civilian career and continue your education at the same time, and many options other than traditional education programs.

[**Work Study**](/education/work-learn/workstudy/)  
This program allows you to use your GI Bill for higher education while working for VA.

[**On-the-Job Training and Apprenticeships**](/education/work-learn/job-and-apprenticeship/) 
VA makes GI Bill payments to employers while you learn a vocational trade through a certification course or union training. During this time, you may receive military housing allowance benefits. 

[**Non-College Degree Programs**](/education/work-learn/non-college-degree-program/) 
The GI Bill may pay all or a portion of your tuition, as well as providing a books and supplies stipend and a monthly housing allowance, while you get your training at an approved institution. 

[**Co-op Training**](/education/work-learn/co-op-training/)  
The GI Bill provides educational assistance for programs that require periods of work alternating with periods of full-time education.

[**Non-Traditional Options**](/education/work-learn/non-traditional/) 
The GI Bill supplements distance learning and correspondence courses, which can be helpful if you need to attend some or all courses remotely because you are balancing work and education.

[**Entrepreneurship Training**](/education/advanced-training-and-certifications/entrepreneurship-training/) 
You can start or grow your own business using skills you learned in the military in combination with business-management training. You may receive reimbursement through the GI Bill for approved entrepreneurship courses.

**Internships, Volunteer Work, and Community Service**  
Internships and volunteer work can advance your career and expand your network while you further your education. Community involvement and service are also productive ways to network with civilians and open the door to future employment possibilities. VA offers [internships](http://mycareeratva.va.gov/library/55) and [volunteer opportunities](http://www.volunteer.va.gov/).
