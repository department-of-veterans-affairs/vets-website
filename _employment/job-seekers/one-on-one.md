One-on-one assistance can help you transition by providing current perspectives on workplaces, targeted job-search techniques, coaching, and résumé building. There are many government and private resources available to you as you make this transition, including:

- The [Transition Assistance Program](http://www.benefits.va.gov/tap/) (TAP)
- VA's [Education and Career Counseling](http://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/edu_voc_counseling.asp) program
- The [Veteran Employment Services Office](http://vaforvets.va.gov/) (VESO)
- The [Veterans Economic Community Initiative](https://employment.vets.gov/employment/job-seekers/veci/) (VECI)
- Private nonprofit organizations that help transitioning Veterans
- [VA for Vets](http://vaforvets.va.gov/) (can help you navigate the federal hiring process)
- [Homeless Veterans Community Employment Services](http://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/HVCES.asp) (HVCES) 
- The [Compensated Work Therapy (CWT)](http://www.va.gov/health/cwt/) program for Veterans with severe service-related disabilities

</div>

### How it works
Transitioning Servicemembers are required to attend the TAP briefings. These include: 

- Preseparation counseling, in which your skills, interests, and goals are evaluated and integrated into a custom roadmap. 
- Résumé-building assistance and interview training.
- Three optional additional workshops: Career Technical Training Track, Education Track, and Entrepreneurship Track.
- Information on all available VA benefits. Contact VA career-and-training specialists at 1-800-827-1000.

##### VA's Education and Career Counseling program

For a year after transitioning out of the military and for the six months prior to separation, Servicemembers may also be eligible for VA's [Education and Career Counseling program](http://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/edu_voc_counseling.asp). If you are eligible, this option focuses on those who are interested in getting the most out of their education benefits. The program includes career counseling, benefits coaching and individual support, and academic counseling. To apply, follow these simple steps: 

1.	Log in to your [eBenefits account](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov).
2.	Select Apply.
3.	Select Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits.
4.	Apply for Education and Career Counseling. Eligible Veterans will receive an invitation to a session at a regional VA office.

You might also want to work with nonprofit organizations that have been thoroughly vetted and can offer you advice, share connections, and help place you into a good job at no cost to you. The [Call of Duty Endowment](http://www.callofdutyendowment.org/partners) endorses groups that do a particularly good job of this.
