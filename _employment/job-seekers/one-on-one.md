### How it works

There are many government and private resources available to you as you make this transition.

#### All Veterans
- [Veteran Employment Specialists](http://vaforvets.va.gov/hr/RVECS/Pages/default.asp) from the Veteran Employment Services Office (VESO) can help you find jobs in your area. 

- [VA for Vets](http://vaforvets.va.gov/) can help you find VA or other federal jobs.

- Private nonprofit organizations that have been thoroughly vetted can offer you advice, share connections, and help place you into a good job at no cost to you. The [Call of Duty Endowment](http://www.callofdutyendowment.org/partners) endorses groups that do a particularly good job of this.

- [Veterans Economic Community Initiative](https://employment.vets.gov/employment/job-seekers/veci/) (VECI) liaisons can help you connect with local business leaders, schools, and nonprofit groups to maximize your education and economic opportunities.

#### Service-Disabled Veterans
- VA's [Education and Career Counseling](http://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/edu_voc_counseling.asp) program includes career counseling, benefits coaching, individual support, and academic counseling.

- The [Compensated Work Therapy (CWT)](http://www.va.gov/health/cwt/) program helps Veterans with service-related disabilities.

#### Still in the service?
- The Transition Assistance Program (TAP), which you can take before you leave active duty, offers one-on-one guidance. 

#### Homeless Veterans
- [Homeless Veterans Community Employment Services](http://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/HVCES.asp) (HVCES) can help if you are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.
