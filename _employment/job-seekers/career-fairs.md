Career fairs can be an important first step in the search for employment. In-person or online, job fairs enable you to directly and efficiently network with hiring managers from a wide variety of companies. 

Your preparation for job fairs is critical to your success. Here are a few tips:

- Dress professionally.
- Research the companies that will be in attendance, and find out what jobs they have open.
- Prioritize the employers you are interested in, and prepare two to three questions for the representatives of those companies.
- Bring multiple copies of your résumé and any relevant military transcripts.
- Bring business cards to encourage follow-up conversations and questions with prospective employers.
- For virtual or online events, fill out all necessary online profile requirements (including résumé, references, and a professional high-resolution photo), and update your [LinkedIn profile](veteran linkedin link).
