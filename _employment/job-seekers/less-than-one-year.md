#### 12 Months Before Leaving Active Duty

- Fill in any gaps in your education or skill set by taking classes and obtaining certifications and licensures. The [GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/) may be used for some of this prior to exiting the service. 
- Contact your local Transition Assistance Program (TAP) manager to schedule the mandatory Transition Goals, Plans, Success (GPS) curriculum. If you are unable to attend this training, it is available through [Joint Knowledge Online](https://jkodirect.jten.mil), but you must have approval from your service branch to get credit. You must complete the VA Benefits Briefings I and II, the Department of Labor Employment Workshop, and an Individual Transition Plan (ITP). ITPs are service specific, so [check documents related to your branch](https://dodtap.mil/index.html). 
- Review [military transcripts](/employment/job-seekers/military-transcripts/) and service records for accuracy. 
- Think about which industries and careers interest you, using [tools](/employment/job-seekers/interest-profiler/) such as o*Net and CareerScope. 
- Start developing a résumé by [translating military skills](/employment/job-seekers/skills-translator) into equivalent civilian skills. Import these using the [Résumé Builder](/employment/job-seekers/create-resume). 
- Clean up your personal social-media footprint and establish a presence on professional sites like LinkedIn.

#### 6 Months Before Leaving Active Duty

- Complete the [Preseparation Counseling Checklist](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/forms/eforms/dd2648t.pdf) (form DD2648).
-  Compile your service-treatment records and military hospital reports, which can make the filing process smoother if you should eventually register for VA medical resources. Both of these can be ordered through the [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/). However, treatment records are not required for registration or treatment at VA.
- Compile private medical records and hospital reports. 
- Finalize your résumé and begin actively [searching for employment](/employment/job-seekers/search_jobs).
- Consider taking one of three additional GPS tracks: Accessing Higher Education, Career Technical Training, or Entrepreneurship. 
- Consider free [education and career counseling](/education/tools-programs/education-career-counseling/).
- At 120 days from separation, you can begin applying for [federal jobs](/employment/job-seekers/federal-employment).
