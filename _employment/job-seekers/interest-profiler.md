You can use tools like [O&#42;Net Interest Profiler](http://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip) to identify the kind of work you enjoy. After taking the short questionnaire, use the results (called an O&#42;Net code) in [targeted job-search engines](http://jobcenter.usa.gov/find-a-job) that may ultimately help you identify a career that fits with the kind of work you enjoy.

The O&#42;NET Interest Profiler can help you find out what your interests are and how those interests relate to the world of work; you can find out what you like to do. The O&#42;NET Interest Profiler helps you decide what kinds of careers you may want to explore. The purpose of this activity is to:
- Learn the relationship between interests and level of preparation on job choices
- Learn the O&#42;NET site as a resource to find knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) for your proposed
career of choice
- Use this data to conduct a self-assessment

Wherever you are with your level of career choice, this assessment can have value for you. If you
are resolute in your choice, your results may confirm what you already know; they can refine your
understanding of it—or possibly present you with some new perspectives you had not considered.

This is an interactive tool for job seekers and students to learn more about their career options. My Next Move has tasks, skills, salary information, and more for over 900 different careers. Users can find careers through keyword search; by browsing industries that employ different types of workers; or through the O&#42;NET Interest Profiler, a tool that offers personalized career suggestions based on a person’s interests and level of work experience.

Similarly, the VA CareerScope Assessment Profile provides a detailed report on interest areas such as humanitarian, mechanical, scientific, or artistic. This should be used in conjunction with your O&#42;Net results and should be shared with your career counselor. Together you may be able to more accurately target employment opportunities.

[CareerScope](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/careerscope.asp) enhances the career and educational planning process by measuring both interest and
aptitude. Career recommendations can be generated that are consistent with the Guide for Occupational
Exploration (GOE), the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), O&#42;NET as well as the U.S. DOE Career
Clusters and Pathways.

The CareerScope self-assessment is designed to measure your aptitudes and interests. After you
complete the assessment, you will use the results as well as other factors to identify potential career
options.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in partnership with the Vocational Research Institute launched
CareerScope. CareerScope will provide career recommendations that align with your interests and
aptitudes.

CareerScope enhances the career and educational planning process by measuring both interest and aptitude through valid and reliable assessment tasks. CareerScope will identify your attraction to careers as they relate to the U.S. Department of Labor’s Interest Areas. It measures aptitudes that are most critical for today’s high growth and high replacement occupations through 2016. It includes a 12-scale interest inventory and a seven-part aptitude battery.
