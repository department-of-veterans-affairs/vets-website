The [Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/content/veteran-service-disabled-veteran-owned) and VAâ€™s Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization in collaboration with [Business USA](http://business.usa.gov/) have resources to support you in starting a new business or growing an existing one. These resources help you with business-plan writing, funding, licensure and permits, mentoring, marketing, how to contract with the government, and more. 

Your SBA representative may also be able to help you find and register for other state and federal start-up assistance, such as [Veteran-owned small-business preference](/employment/job-seekers/service-disabled).
