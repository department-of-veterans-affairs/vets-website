The Veterans Employment Center can help spouses and family members access valuable career resources. 

Through the Department of Defense’s [Spouse Education Career Opportunities](https://myseco.militaryonesource.mil/Portal/) (SECO) program, spouses can use government-sponsored career and education resources, take advantage of networking opportunities, and work with employment counselors. SECO also partners with the [Military Spouse Employment Partnership](https://msepjobs.militaryonesource.mil/msep/) (MSEP) and [My Career Advancement Account](https://myseco.militaryonesource.mil/Portal/Media/Default/Collaterals_Catalog/Program_Overview/MyCAA-Helping-Spouses-Reach-Career-Goals.pdf) (MyCAA) scholarship program. These organizations and others (like [Blue Star Families](https://www.bluestarfam.org/)) offer assistance for spouses interested in:
-	connecting with employers committed to hiring military spouses or
-	pursuing additional education and/or training.  

### Are you eligible for SECO services? 
Yes, if:
-	You are the spouse of an active-duty, National Guard, or Reserve Servicemember in the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, or Air Force, or 
-	You are the spouse of a Servicemember who has been separated from active duty, National Guard, or Reserves for less than 180 days.
-	You are the surviving spouse of a Servicemember who died while on active duty.

### How it works
Sign up for a current DS Logon ID. This is the same login used for online services like TRICARE. If you are unsure of your DS Logon, visit [My Access Center](https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/identitymanagement/help.do?execution=e1s1).
-	Request a logon account.  
-	Register on the SECO site.

### Other Programs
-	The [Military Spouse eMentor Program](https://ementorprogram.org/p/milspouse/about) links spouses to career-specific mentors. 
-	The [Military Spouse Fellowship Program](http://www.saveandinvest.org/military/military-spouse-fellowship-program) offers 50 spouses a year (at no cost to themselves) the opportunity to earn the Accredited Financial Counselor® certificate.

Start your own business 
If entrepreneurship interests you, learn about everything from start-up costs to business, accounting, and financial assistance with three programs: [SCORE](https://www.score.org/topics/veteran_guards_reservists ), the [Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/content/veteran-service-disabled-veteran-owned)(SBA), and [Entrepreneurship Boot Camp](https://myseco.militaryonesource.mil/Portal/Content/View/2622). 

If you are a surviving spouse, the [Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors](http://www.taps.org/) offers seminars, peer mentors, and other forms of support to help you complete your education or find a sustainable career. 

Spouses can attend Department of Labor Employment Workshops (DOLEW) online through the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) Virtual Curriculum on [Joint Knowledge Online](https://jkodirect.jten.mil), on the [Department of Labor website](https://www.dol.gov/vets/) or in person at some military installations. These workshops focus on building résumés and cover letters as well as developing networking and interviewing skills.
