The Veterans Employment Center can help spouses and family members access valuable career resources. 

Through the Department of Defense’s [Spouse Education Career Opportunities](https://myseco.militaryonesource.mil/Portal/) (SECO) program, spouses can use government-sponsored career and education resources, take advantage of networking opportunities, and work with employment counselors. SECO also partners with the [Military Spouse Employment Partnership](https://msepjobs.militaryonesource.mil/msep/) (MSEP) and [My Career Advancement Account](https://myseco.militaryonesource.mil/Portal/Media/Default/Collaterals_Catalog/Program_Overview/MyCAA-Helping-Spouses-Reach-Career-Goals.pdf) (MyCAA) scholarship program. These organizations and others (such as [Blue Star Families](https://www.bluestarfam.org/)) offer assistance for spouses interested in the following:

- Connecting with employers committed to hiring military spouses.
- Pursuing additional education and/or training.

### Other programs
- The [Military Spouse eMentor Program](https://ementorprogram.org/p/milspouse/about) links spouses to career-specific mentors. 
- The [Military Spouse Fellowship Program](http://www.saveandinvest.org/military/military-spouse-fellowship-program) offers 50 spouses a year (at no cost to themselves) the opportunity to earn the Accredited Financial Counselor® certificate.
- If you are a surviving spouse, the [Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors](http://www.taps.org/) offers seminars, peer mentors, and other forms of support to help you complete your education or find a sustainable career. 
- Spouses can attend Department of Labor Employment Workshops (DOLEW) online through the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) Virtual Curriculum on [Joint Knowledge Online](https://jkodirect.jten.mil), on the [Department of Labor website](https://www.dol.gov/vets/), or in person at some military installations. These workshops focus on building résumés and cover letters as well as developing networking and interviewing skills.
