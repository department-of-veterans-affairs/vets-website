Plan for your transition from the military as soon as you know you’ll be exiting the service. Steps you and your spouse take early on can have a big impact on your successful transition.

**Online Presence**

Make sure your online presence is what you want it to be.

Protect:
- Search your name, and variations on your name, in several search engines. If you find something that you would not want an employer to see, request that the source remove it. 
- Ensure that your personal social-media profiles are set to private.
- Do not post, or allow others to post, information on social media that an employer might find controversial or inappropriate.

Establish:
- Learn how professional civilian networks, like LinkedIn, function. 
- Connect online with organizations in which you are interested. 
- Follow companies you might consider working for.

Build:
- Start establishing your network long before you begin your job search.
- Maintain your network presence. Regularly contribute to your network page with thoughtful, professional content, or share the professional content of others you find interesting. 

**Consider More Education**

- Decide if pursuing a college degree, an advanced degree, or a vocational technical degree is the right path for you. 
- Begin researching schools and programs that will help you reach your goals.
- Consider [alternative options](/employment/job-seekers/alternative/) such as on-the-job training or an apprenticeship. 
- Research how to access your [GI Bill benefits](/education/gi-bill/) and the financial impact of pursuing an education versus a career. 


**Résumé Building**

Your résumé is a living document. Visit a [VA Employment Center](/_dummy-placeholder.html) and get help preparing yours in the right format for the type of job you want.

Basic tips:
- Your résumé should be one to two pages for every ten years of work experience. The exception to this rule is for a [Federal Job Application](https://www.usajobs.gov/). 
- Build your general résumé, following a standard format. Your post-education office will have more information as well as sample résumé templates.
- Keep your résumé updated during your military career.
- Have a basic cover letter for each résumé type

**Ramp Up Before You Begin Searching for a Job**

Start a list of fields that interest you. A resource for this is the [Interest Profiler](/employment/job-seekers/interest-profiler/).
