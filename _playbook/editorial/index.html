<p>Language communicates our humanity. In the context of a website, it conjures up the people on the other side of that glowing screen. It engages, builds trust, and guides visitors through processes and information that can be stressful and confusing.</p>

<p>The primary headline on our home page reflects that: How can we help?

<p>Vets.gov’s language is clear and direct, yet its tone is warm and quiet. We respect Veterans’ time, so we get to the point. And we avoid bureaucratese.</p>

<p>We don’t say <em>utilize</em> when <em>use</em> works just as well.</p>

<p>We avoid saying <em>manifested</em>, because <em>started</em> says it better.</p>

<p>We distill and simplify. We’re not selling programs and benefits, but rather helping Veterans and their families understand whether a benefit is right for them so they can make informed choices about how to proceed. Our goal is to give Veterans and their families the information they need to make important decisions confidently, easily—and done.</p>
