        <h4>Services and Infrastructure</h4>
        <p>Our platform provides central services, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Secure accounts</li>
          <li>Robust analytics</li>
          <li>Visual design assets</li>
          <li>UX Pattern System</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These applications (apps) are well scoped and grouped by category. Using employment as an example, you’ll find apps for searching for jobs, posting a profile, and translating military service into civilian skills.</p>
        <p>Apps are created by internal teams, contractors, or others, such as the <abbr>VERC</abbr> or <abbr>18F</abbr>. All will benefit from our platform’s infrastructure in delivering improved functionality to customers more quickly. They’ll be able to do so without sacrificing quality, security, or privacy. New apps may be designed and sponsored by a business office, a VA administration, or in certain cases by the <abbr>VE</abbr> and/or <abbr>DSE</abbr> team. Our platform was built and is maintained internally within VA. It’s run by the VA Digital Service.</p>
        <h4>Standards</h4>
        <p>To be included in our platform, apps must meet rigorous standards. They need to be 508-compliant and adhere to automated test and code review standards. In some cases, a legacy system will simply not make the cut.</p>
        <h4>Levels of Complexity</h4>
        <p>The Vets.gov platform will include features ranging from basic instructional content to personalized applications.</p>
        <p>More to come very soon!</p>
