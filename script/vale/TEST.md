#### Conversational Tone
When referring to VA, use the first-person pronoun (we, us, our).
When referring to Veterans, service members, family member, use the second person pronoun (you, your)

<!-- NOTE These are more like grammatical rules, hard to fix in vale -->

#### Sentence-case capitalization
We use sentence-case capitalization for most content, including page titles, headings, subheadings, buttons, and text links unless a word is a proper noun.

(Examples of proper nouns: “VA.gov,” the word “Veteran" or "Veterans," official VA program names, state names, names of federal agencies, days of the week, months, book titles)

<!-- Each of these are subcategories:

- VA specific proper nouns (Brand.yml)
- VA Program names (Brand.yml or Jargon.yml)
- State names
- Federal agencies
- Days of the week, months
- Book titles  -->

#### Time
--Write out times, using a.m. and p.m. with periods: for example, 9:00 a.m. NOT: 9 am or 9 a.m.
--Spell out noon and midnight. Don’t use 12:00 p.m. or 12:00 a.m.
