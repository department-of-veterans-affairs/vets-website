<h3 itemprop="name">Can I get VA health care benefits?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You may be able to get VA health care benefits if you served in the active military, naval, or air service and didn't receive a dishonorable discharge.

- **If you enlisted after September 7, 1980, or entered active duty after October 16, 1981,** you must have served 24 continuous months or the full period for which you were called to active duty, unless any of the descriptions below are true for you.</br>
</br>
**This minimum duty requirement may not apply if any of these are true. You:**
  - Were discharged for a disability that was caused—or made worse—by your active-duty service, **or**
  - Were discharged for a hardship or “early out,” **or**
  - Served prior to September 7, 1980

- **If you’re a current or former member of the Reserves or National Guard,** you must have been called to active duty by a federal order and completed the full period for which you were called or ordered to active duty. If you had or have active-duty status for training purposes only, you don’t qualify for VA health care.

### What should I do if I received an other than honorable, bad conduct, or dishonorable discharge?

If you've received one of these discharge statuses, you may not be eligible for VA benefits.

**There are 2 ways you can try to qualify:**

<h3 itemprop="name">Is there anything that will make me more likely to get these benefits?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

Yes. You may qualify for enhanced eligibility status (meaning you’ll be placed in a higher priority group, which makes you more likely to get benefits) if you meet at least one of the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true. You:** 

- Receive financial compensation (payments) from VA for a service-connected disability
- Were discharged for a disability resulting from something that happened to you in the line of duty
- Were discharged for a disability that got worse in the line of duty
- Are a recently discharged Combat Veteran
- Get a VA pension
- Are a former Prisoner of War (POW)
- Have received a Purple Heart
- Get (or qualify for) Medicaid benefits
- Served in Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975
- Served in Southwest Asia during the Gulf War between August 2, 1990, and November 11, 1998
- Served at least 30 days at Camp Lejeune between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987

**If none of the above apply to you**, you may still qualify for care based on your income. Learn more about how the amount of money your family makes can affect whether you qualify for VA benefits. <br>

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">

<h4 itemprop="name">What are priority groups and how do they affect me?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

When you apply for VA health care, you’ll be assigned 1 of 8 priority groups. This system helps to make sure that Veterans who need immediate care can get signed up quickly.

Your priority group may affect how soon we sign you up for health care benefits. It may also affect how much (if anything) you’ll have to pay toward the cost of your care.<br/>
[Learn more about health benefit copay rates](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/cost/copay_rates.asp).

**Your priority group will be based on:**

- Your military service history, **and**
- Your disability rating, **and**
- Your income level, **and**
- Whether or not you qualify for Medicaid, **and**
- Other benefits you may be receiving (like pension benefits)

We assign Veterans with service-connected disabilities the highest priority. We assign the lowest priority to Veterans who earn a higher income and who don’t have any service-connected disabilities qualifying them for disability compensation (monthly payments).<br/>
