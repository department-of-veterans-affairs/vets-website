<div class="va-introtext">

You may be able to get disability benefits if you have signs of an illness like hypertension (high blood pressure), arthritis, diabetes, or peptic ulcers that started within a year after you were discharged from active military service.


If your symptoms appear within 1 year after discharge—even if they weren’t there while you were serving—we’ll conclude that they’re related to your service. <br>

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits. When you apply, you’ll have to show that your illness is at least 10% disabling. (For example, you may include a doctor’s report showing that you’re taking medicine for your high blood pressure.) You’ll also need to show that the illness appeared within 1 year after being discharged from active service. <br>
[Find out how to apply for benefits](/disability-benefits/apply/).

**Exception:**<br>
The following diseases are covered, even if they appear more than 1 year after you separated:


-	Hansen&#8217;s disease (a long-lasting infection that affects your skin, nerves, and mucous membranes) can appear within 3 years after discharge.
-	Tuberculosis (an infection that attacks your lungs and sometimes other areas of your body) can appear within 3 years after discharge.
-	Multiple sclerosis (a long-lasting illness that can cause numbness, weakness, and many other symptoms) can appear within 7 years after discharge.
-	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease (a long-lasting illness that affects muscle control), can appear any time after discharge.
