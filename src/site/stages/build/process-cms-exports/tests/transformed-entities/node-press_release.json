Suffoletto also oversees patient and staff education as the health care system's associate chief of staff for education and innovative learning.</p>\n\n<p>\"I love working with our Veterans here at VA Pittsburgh. I find our patients to be extraordinarily resilient and kind people. I am humbled by how appreciative they are for the care that they receive,\" Suffoletto said. \"And I love being a part of their health care community, especially when I see the way our Veterans care for each other in the hospital and in the outpatient clinics.\"</p>\n\n<p>Photos available upon request.</p>"
