        <h4>Medical Records</h4>
        <p>
          If you’re claiming a burial allowance for a service-connected death,
          you can submit supporting documents about their medical information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> It’s your choice whether you want to submit
          supporting documents. This information may help us process your claim
          and confirm details about the deceased Veteran’s medical information
          at the time of their death.
        </p>
        <h5>If you have access</h5>
        <p>
          If you have access to the Veteran's medical records, you can submit
          copies of them with your online application or send them to us by
          mail.
        </p>
        <h5>If you don’t have access</h5>
        <p>
          If you don’t have access to the Veteran’s medical records, you’ll need
          to authorize the release of their records to us. How you release their
          records depends on where the Veteran was receiving care at the time of
          their death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Provide details about the records or information you want us to
          request. This will help us request this information.
