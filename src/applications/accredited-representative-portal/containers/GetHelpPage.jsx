            The Accredited Representative Portal is a secure online tool for
            accredited representatives to efficiently establish representation
            and manage their work supporting Veterans and dependents through the
            benefits claims process.

              The portal opens to all accredited representatives in Fall 2025.
              At that time, representatives will be able to complete these
              tasks:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Establish representation by accepting requests that were
                  submitted using online {RepresentationLink()} on VA.gov.
                  Access the VBMS eFolder within minutes of establishing
                  representation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Search for claimants to verify whether you or your
                  organization represents them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upload and submit completed PDFs and evidence for VA Forms
                  21-686c and 21-526EZ.
                </li>
              </ul>
              We will expand the portal’s capabilities over time, starting with
              these tasks:
              <ul>
                <li>Access the portal with the ID.me sign-in method</li>
                <li>Submit additional types of VA forms</li>
                <li>View summary information about a claimant</li>
                <li>
                  Complete and submit the Application for Accreditation as a
                  Claims Agent or Attorney (VA Form 21a)
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Accredited representatives must sign in to the portal with a
                VA-approved sign-in account. During sign-in, the system checks
                with the VA’s Office of General Counsel (OGC) to confirm current
                accreditation. If the system can’t verify current accreditation,
                we restrict access to portal features. These identity checks
                make fraud very difficult.
              </p>
              <p>
                To submit {RepresentationLink()} on VA.gov, Veterans must sign
                in to their {VAGovLink()} account, which requires authentication
                with Login.gov or ID.me. By requiring sign-in with these
                methods, we ensure that all submitters have verified their
                identity with the federal government.

                For you to receive a request in the portal, the Veteran needs to
                submit the online {RepresentationLink()} on VA.gov. They will
                need to sign in to VA.gov to submit the form. Instruct the
                Veteran to select you as the accredited representative, and to
                appoint one of your organizations that accepts online
                submissions when filling out the online form. Once the Veteran
                submits the online form, a representation request will populate
                in the portal and can be reviewed by any representative who is
                accredited with the appointed VSO.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> We encourage you to test completing the
                online {RepresentationLink()} to understand the Veteran
                experience.

                After signing in to the portal, you can review a list of
                representation requests that appoint one of your VSOs. If the
                Veteran specified an individual representative they would like
                to work with, the request would include the name of this
                individual in the preferred representative field.
              </p>
              <p>
                The request details show whether the Veteran authorized access
                to protected medical records and address changes. After
                reviewing this information, you (or any other representative
                accredited with the appointed VSO) can accept or decline the
                request. The portal will then send a notification of the
                decision to the Veteran. Once you accept representation, you can
                view the Veteran’s eFolder in VBMS within minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                To meet additional security standards, representation requests
                expire after 60 days. Expired requests are removed from the
                portal for data security purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> The portal only shows requests that were
                submitted using online {RepresentationLink()}. It will not show
                requests made through mail, fax, QuickSubmit, or other tools.
                Also, the portal is the only tool where you can view these
                online requests.

              To search for a claimant, you’ll need to enter their first name,
              last name, date of birth, and Social Security number. Even if you
              enter the information correctly, you’ll receive a “No result
              found” message if the individual doesn’t have a recent
              representation request or existing representation with you or one
              of your VSOs.

                The portal doesn’t currently check for limited representation.
                By limited representation, we mean that the representation is
                for a specific claim or claims. Check with the claimant or in
                VBMS for any existing limited representation.
