            The Accredited Representative Portal is a secure online tool for
            accredited representatives to efficiently establish representation
            and manage their work supporting Veterans and dependents through the
            benefits claims process.
          </p>

              The portal opens to all accredited representatives in Fall 2025.
              At that time, representatives will be able to complete these
              tasks:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Establish representation by accepting requests that were
                  submitted using online {RepresentationLink()} on VA.gov.
                  Access the VBMS eFolder within minutes of establishing
                  representation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Search for claimants to verify whether you or your
                  organization represents them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upload and submit completed PDFs and evidence for VA Forms
                  21-686c and 21-526EZ.
                </li>
              </ul>
              We will expand the portal’s capabilities over time, starting with
              these tasks:
              <ul>
                <li>Access the portal with the ID.me sign-in method</li>
                <li>Submit additional types of VA forms</li>
                <li>View summary information about a claimant</li>
                <li>
                  Complete and submit the Application for Accreditation as a
                  Claims Agent or Attorney (VA Form 21a)
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Accredited representatives must sign in to the portal with a
                VA-approved sign-in account. During sign-in, the system checks
                with the VA’s Office of General Counsel (OGC) to confirm current
                accreditation. If the system can’t verify current accreditation,
                we restrict access to portal features. These identity checks
                make fraud very difficult.
              </p>
              <p>
                To submit {RepresentationLink()} on VA.gov, Veterans must sign
                in to their {VAGovLink()} account, which requires authentication
                with Login.gov or ID.me. By requiring sign-in with these
                methods, we ensure that all submitters have verified their
                identity with the federal government.

          <p>
            Before using the Accredited Representative Portal (ARP) you will
            need to create a Login.gov account and associate it with your email
            on file with the VA’s Office of General Counsel (OGC).

              <h4>Step 1: Identify the email you have on file with OGC.</h4>
              If you’re unsure which email you have on file with OGC, start by
              looking yourself up using the{' '}
              <Link

                Find a Representative tool on VA.gov

                OGC accreditation search tool
              </Link>
              . If your record appears in the OGC tool but not in the Find a
              Representative tool, it likely means VA doesn’t have a valid
              physical address on file for you.
              <h4>Step 2: Create a Login.gov account</h4>
              Login.gov is a secure way to sign in to many government websites
              with one account. Follow the instructions on Login.gov to create
              an account. Login.gov recommends that you use a personal email
              you’ll always have access to. You can use your work email instead
              if you prefer.
              <h4>
                Step 3: Associate your OGC email with your Login.gov account
              </h4>
              If you created your Login.gov account with your personal email,
              you’ll need to add the email address you have on file with OGC.
              While signed in to Login.gov, go to the “Your Account” menu and
              select “Add email address.” Enter your OGC email address and
              follow the prompts to confirm it.
              <h4>Step 4: Sign in to the portal</h4>
              Sign in to the portal at{' '}

                If you’re a Veteran Service Organization (VSO) representative,
                reach out to the certifying official at your Veteran Service
                Organization who handles the accreditation process. Ask them to
                request that OGC add an email to your file or update your
                existing email. If your contact information or physical address
                is outdated, request that OGC update it as well. We recommend
                against using a PO Box, since this will prevent your record from
                appearing in the Find a Representative tool.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re unsure who your certifying official is, contact your
                supervisor for guidance. Once the update is complete, add the
                new email address to your Login.gov account and try signing in
                to the portal.

              Make sure the email address you have on file with OGC is unique to
              you. If you’re using a shared organization email that other
              representatives also use, the portal won’t grant you access. In
              that case, you’ll need to update your OGC email to one that only
              you use.

              The benefits you receive as a Veteran won’t be affected when you

            You can quickly establish representation with a Veteran by using the

              <p>
                For you to receive a request in the portal, the Veteran needs to
                submit the online {RepresentationLink()} on VA.gov. They will
                need to sign in to VA.gov to submit the form. Instruct the
                Veteran to select you as the accredited representative, and to
                appoint one of your organizations that accepts online
                submissions when filling out the online form. Once the Veteran
                submits the online form, a representation request will populate
                in the portal and can be reviewed by any representative who is
                accredited with the appointed VSO.

                After signing in to the portal, you can review a list of
                representation requests that appoint one of your VSOs. If the
                Veteran specified an individual representative they would like
                to work with, the request would include the name of this
                individual in the preferred representative field.
              </p>
              <p>
                The request details show whether the Veteran authorized access
                to protected medical records and address changes. After
                reviewing this information, you (or any other representative
                accredited with the appointed VSO) can accept or decline the
                request. The portal will then send a notification of the
                decision to the Veteran. Once you accept representation, you can

              To search for a claimant, you’ll need to enter their first name,
              last name, date of birth, and Social Security number. Even if you
              enter the information correctly, you’ll receive a “No result
              found” message if the individual doesn’t have a recent
              representation request or existing representation with you or one
              of your VSOs.

                The portal doesn’t currently check for limited representation.
                By limited representation, we mean that the representation is
                for a specific claim or claims. Check with the claimant or in
                VBMS for any existing limited representation.

            individual, you can submit forms through the portal on their behalf.

              To submit VA forms, you will need to upload a completed PDF of the
              form and any additional relevant evidence or documentation. Prior
              to submission, the system will verify that you or one of your VSOs
              has existing representation with the claimant. We’ll notify you of
              the status of receipt in VBMS and track submissions for 60 days.
