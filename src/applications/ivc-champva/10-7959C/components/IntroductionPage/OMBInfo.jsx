      <strong>Privacy Act information:</strong> VA is asking you to provide the
      information on this form under 38 U.S.C. Sections 1705,1710, 1712, and
      1722 in order for VA to determine your eligibility for medical benefits.
      Information you supply may be verified from initial submission forward
      through a computer-matching program. VA may disclose the information that
      you put on the form as permitted by law. VA may make a “routine use”
      disclosure of the information as outlined in the Privacy Act systems of
      records notices and in accordance with the VHA Notice of Privacy
      Practices. Providing the requested information is voluntary, but if any or
      all of the requested information is not provided, it may delay or result
      in denial of your request for health care benefits. Failure to furnish the
      information will not have any effect on any other benefits to which you
      may be entitled. If you provide VA your Social Security Number, VA will
      use it to administer your VA benefits. VA may also use this information to
      identify Veterans and persons claiming or receiving VA benefits and their
      records, and for other purposes authorized or required by law.
