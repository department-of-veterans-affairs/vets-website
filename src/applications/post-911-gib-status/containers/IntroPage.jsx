            <p>Your Post-9/11 GI Bill Statement of Benefits might not be available if one of these is true:
              <ul>
                <li>The name on your Vets.gov account doesn’t exactly match the name we have in our Post-9/11 GI Bill records.</li>
                <li>We’re still processing your education benefits application and we haven’t yet created a record for you. We usually process applications within 60 days. If you applied less than 60 days ago, please check back soon.</li>
                <li>A family member or dependent is trying to access your benefit statement, and they might not be authorized to use the tool.</li>
                <li>You haven’t yet applied for Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits. <a href="/education/apply/" target="_blank">Apply for education benefits.</a>

                <li>You’re not eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits.</li>
                <li>You’re trying to access the tool during its scheduled downtime. The tool is available Sunday through Friday, 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. (ET), and Saturday 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. (ET).</li>

              If none of the above situations applies to you, and you think your Statement of Benefits should be here, please call the Vets.gov Help Desk at 1-855-574-7286. We’re here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. (ET).
