# Background

From time to time Veterans need to make updates to the dependents they receive benefits for. These updates can be when a divorce happens, or a death, or a new child is born, etc. The 686c form is how these changes to dependents are made.

## How the form works for the user

Since the Veteran may be making any one of various changes to dependents, there are multiple paths, or workflows, they can take through the form. When the veteran starts the form they are shown an introduction page with some information about what is in the form. Then they are taken to a "option selection" page where they can choose what workflow they want to take through the form. The paths the Veteran can take through the form can be any of the following -

- `Add your spouse`
- `Add a spouse`
- `Remove a divorced spouse`
- `Remove a spouse, child or dependent parent who has died`
- `Remove a stepchild who has left your household`
- `Remove a child 18 to 23 years old who has stopped attending school`
- `Add a child 18 to 23 years old</strong> who'll be attending school` (VA Form 21-674)

> You will notice that the last workflow is technically a totally separate form (the form 21-674). The stakeholders wanted this form added as a workflow to this form since it deals with making changes to a dependent. That workflow actually submits using a separate job than the 686c does. This is detailed further in the back end section.

The Veteran can choose as many or as few of these workflows at a time. This means the Veteran could potentially come into the form and select multiple workflows and we show them only the parts they need to see. For instance, if you choose to `Add your spouse` AND choose `Remove a divorced spouse` we would show you the pages dealing with those two workflows but ONLY those two workflows. This is done using [depends](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/forms/common-patterns-for-building-forms/#conditionally-including-a-page) in the code and is detailed below.

Once the user chooses the workflows they want, they move through the form filling out the fields and are then shown a review page of what they are about to submit. They can then submit and see a confirmation screen that they submitted the form.

## The Front End code

Since the 686c is a rather large form we decided to split the form chapters up into smaller files instead of putting them all in one huge file. We broke these files up into individual folders for each respective chapter. You can find each individual chapter folder inside `/config`. You will also see a few files inside the `/config` folder that are not inside the chapter folders, these files are -

- `constants.js`- Holds a few constants specific to our form
- `form.js` - Uses all of the individual chapters to build a form schema which is then used to build the form
- `helpers.js` - Holds a few helpers used for the UI
- `utilities.js` - Holds a few utility functions we use like validations

The form system uses Redux and thus we also use Redux in our form so we have a `/actions` and a `/reducers` folder to hold the respective Redux code.

> It is worth noting that we make an API call when the user lands on the introduction page of the form to check that they have a valid VA file number. We check for this VA file number because we submit this form to BGS and we cannot submit the form without that VA file number. The code to check if the user has a valid VA file number is inside the `/actions/index.js` and `/reducers/index.js` files respectively.




## Callouts on how the front end works

We used the original form system with USWDS v3 web-components to build this application and we followed a pretty standard implementation with just a few areas worth noting.

### Valid VA file number check (front end)

The form is built using `/config/form.js` which is imported and used inside `/containers/App.jsx` with the `<RoutedSavableApp />` component from the platform. In `/containers/App.jsx` we dynamically render a loading indicator if the app is in an `isLoading` state from Redux. This allows us to show a loading indicator while we make the call to check if the Veteran has a valid VA file number as noted in the block quote above. The back end of that valid VA file number is detailed below in the back end section. Once the call is made and the form renders we either show the user an alert if they do not have a valid VA file number, or a `<SaveInProgressIntro />` component from the platform to start the form.

### Option Selection

The first page a Veteran sees when they enter the form from the introduction page are checkboxes where they can choose to Add dependents, Remove dependents, or both. The original design for our form intended for us only to show the chapters that the Veteran needed to see; the idea would be that we would show the Veteran a list of tasks they could accomplish using the form and they could pick whatever ones they wanted to perform, then we would only show the Veteran the chapters they needed to see to accomplish those tasks.

The way we do this in the code is by using the `depends` attribute for the optional chapters inside `/config/form.js` along with a helper method called [isChapterFieldRequired](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/a4babda01dac9cbb30feded94e92ea8f557b69be/src/applications/disability-benefits/686c-674/config/helpers.js#L7) and passing in the `formData` object and the name of that respective chapter. The `isChapterFieldRequired` function then checks if the Veteran selected the task in the wizard associated with that chapter, which we hold in the `formData["view:selectable686Options"]` array in the form data and returns `true` and shows that chapter if it corresponds to a task the Veteran selected.

### Array Builder Implementation

This version of the form relies heavily on the latest List and Loop pattern, known to engineering as the Array Builder. There are 7 total arrays built by this pattern and used in this form. They are built into the following sections:

- addSpouse > veteranMarriageHistory
- addSpouse > spouseMarriageHistory
- addChildren
- addStudents
- removeStepchild (or child who no longer lives w/ Veteran)
- removeDeceased
- removeMarriedChild
- removeChildNoLongerInSchool

Note: This pattern is a work in progress and some features from previous patterns aren't supported here. This can include RJSF helpers like 'expandUnder'. These features and others will be supported in the near future, as the Veteran Facing Forms teams rolls out updates.

## The back end code

There are really two separate API endpoints that we use in the 686c form, one of them dealing with the check for a valid VA file number noted in the front end sections, and one that receives the form payload on submission. The endpoint for the VA file number check is located at [vets-api/app/controllers/v0/profile/valid_va_file_numbers_controller.rb](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/d6a57d2046248013e52a38fc490c1cd6e5cb955c/app/controllers/v0/profile/valid_va_file_numbers_controller.rb#L1) and the endpoint for the submission payload is at [vets-api/app/controllers/v0/dependents_applications_controller.rb](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/d6a57d2046248013e52a38fc490c1cd6e5cb955c/app/controllers/v0/dependents_applications_controller.rb#L1).

### Valid VA file number check (back end)

When the Veteran first lands on the Introduction page of the form a call is made to `vets-api/app/controllers/v0/profile/valid_va_file_numbers_controller.rb` where we use BGS as a data source to see if the current user has valid VA file number. We do this with the `valid_va_file_number_data` method call which simply takes the data returned by BGS for the current user and sees if the user has a `file_nbr` which is where BGS holds the file number. If the user has a valid VA file number we return `true`, otherwise we return `false`, to the front end.

### Form submission

After the Veteran fills out the form and submits the payload it is sent to `vets-api/app/controllers/v0/dependents_applications_controller.rb` on the back end. The main method we use in that controller is the `create` method, this method starts out by creating a `claim` object. The `claim` object is created with the `new` method of the `DependencyClaim`. We then check if for some reason the `claim` did not get created, meaning that the form payload has not passed our validation (more on this in a moment), we then log the error and raise an exception.

After we create the claim we then process any attached documents, which are needed for some of the workflows in the form, and then using the dependents service we send the data to BGS. In addition to sending the data to BGS we also use `PDFtk` to create a PDF that we then send to VBMS. VBMS then uploads the PDF to the Veteran's eFolder (like a "my documents" folder at the VA for each Veteran). Once the claim has been submitted successfully, at this point we clear out the current saved claim data so that this claim doesn't stay in the Veteran's `save in progress` function on the form. We then render JSON to the front end.

### After submission

When we submit the claim using the `dependent_service` call inside `vets-api/app/controllers/v0/dependents_applications_controller.rb`, that service can kick off three separate jobs based on the payload of the form. Previously we talked about how the user can select different workflows through the form, some of them specific to the 21-686c and one of them specific to the 21-674 form. Based on which workflow the Veteran filled out we use the `dependent_service` to kick off a job specific to the 686c, and/ or a job specific to the 674, and a job specific to creating the PDF using `PDFtk` and sending it to VBMS (this third job will always be run).
Depending on the data that was populated, one or both sidekiq jobs for 686C and 674 will be enqueued and run asynchronously. Prior to that, the VBMS PDF job will be run to submit a PDF version of the form. If any of these steps fail, the entire claim will go down a backup path to Lighthouse where the form and attachments will be generated and uploaded into Lighthouse for evaluation
