              Under the GI Bill you’re eligible to receive a monthly housing

              If you use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to take at least 1 in-person
              class, your housing allowance is based on where you do most of
              your coursework. If you take online courses only, your housing
              allowance is based on 50% of the national average.

        <h3>Accreditation and why it matters</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of accreditation is to ensure that the education provided by
          institutions of higher education meets acceptable levels of quality.
          Schools can be accredited by private educational associations of
          regional or national scope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accreditation matters if you plan to start school at one institution
          and transfer to another to complete your degree. Be sure to ask any
          potential school about their credit transfer policy.

          Is the school regionally or nationally accredited at the institution

        </p>
        <p>
          Schools are accredited by private educational associations of regional
          or national scope. While the Department of Education does not say
          whether regional or national accreditation is better, a recent ED
          study revealed that, “Nearly 90 percent of all student credit transfer
          opportunities occurred between institutions that were regionally,
          rather than nationally, accredited.”{' '}

          CAUTION: Not every program approved for GI Bill benefits at an
          accredited school is accredited by the regional or national
          accreditor. Prior to enrolling, it’s important you confirm the program
          you’re seeking is accredited and whether or not your field of study
          requires accreditation for employment and/or licensing.

          <h3>Protection against late VA payments</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          If VA is late making a tuition payment to a GI Bill school, the school
          can’t prevent a GI Bill student from attending classes or accessing
          school facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schools may require students to provide proof of their GI Bill
          eligibility in the form of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Certificate of Eligibility (COE) <strong>or</strong>

            Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and additional criteria like an
            award letter or other documents the school specifies
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>
            In addition, schools can’t charge late fees or otherwise penalize GI
            Bill students if VA is late making a tuition and/or fees payment.
          </strong>{' '}
          This restriction on penalties doesn’t apply if the student owes
          additional fees to the school beyond the tuition and fees that VA
          pays. Students are protected from these penalties for up to 90 days
          from the beginning of the term.
