              If you use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to take at least 1 in-person

              your coursework. If you take online courses only, your housing
              allowance is based on 50% of the national average.

          If VA is late making a tuition payment to a GI Bill school, the school
          can’t prevent a GI Bill student from attending classes or accessing
          school facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schools may require students to provide proof of their GI Bill
          eligibility in the form of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Certificate of Eligibility (COE) <strong>or</strong>

        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>
            In addition, schools can’t charge late fees or otherwise penalize GI
            Bill students if VA is late making a tuition and/or fees payment.
          </strong>{' '}
          This restriction on penalties doesn’t apply if the student owes
          additional fees to the school beyond the tuition and fees that VA
          pays. Students are protected from these penalties for up to 90 days
          from the beginning of the term.

          flag means VA or other federal agencies like the Department of

          or legal scrutiny to this program. VA will display other categories of

          year enlistment vs. 3+ year enlistment) will impact your monthly
          payment amount when using the Montgomery GI Bill. To learn more about
