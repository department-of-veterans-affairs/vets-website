            About ratings
          </span>
          <p>
            We ask Veterans who have used their education benefits to rate
            schools they’ve attended on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 stars
            being the best rating.

            How ratings are collected
          </span>
          <p>
            VA works independently to collect ratings from Veterans. We reach
            out to Veterans to provide a rating who have:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Received a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) for benefits</li>
            <li>Transferred into or out of a school</li>
            <li>
              Made a change to their program of study, <strong>or</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Completed their degree program</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Veterans rate schools on a number of categories. Those ratings are
            averaged to calculate the overall school rating. If a Veteran
            doesn’t rate a category, it has no effect on the category’s overall
            score.
          </p>

            Veteran privacy
          </span>
          <p>
            A school may ask us for a list of Veterans who rated their school,
            but we do not share individual ratings with schools. If an
            institution asks us for information on who rated their school, no
            information beyond what is publicly available on the Comparison Tool
            is shared with them that would tie an individual to their ratings.
