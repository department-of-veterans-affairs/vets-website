      <p>
        The goal of accreditation is to ensure the education provided by
        institutions of higher learning meets acceptable levels of quality.
        Accreditation matters if you plan to start school at one institution and
        transfer to another to complete your degree. Be sure to ask any
        potential school about their credit transfer policy.

        Schools are accredited regionally or nationally by private educational
        associations. While the Department of Education (ED) doesn't say whether
        regional or national accreditation is better, a recent ED study revealed
        that, “Nearly 90 percent of all student credit transfer opportunities
        occurred between institutions that were regionally, rather than
        nationally, accredited.”{' '}
