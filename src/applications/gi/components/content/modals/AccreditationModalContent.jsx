      <p>
        The goal of accreditation is to ensure that the education provided by
        the institutions of higher education meets acceptable levels of quality.
        Accreditation may not be necessary for every program you wish to pursue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accreditation matters if you plan to start school at one institution and
        transfer to another to complete your degree. Be sure to ask any
        potential school you may want to transfer to about its credit transfer
        policy.
      </p>

        CAUTION: Not every program approved for GI Bill benefits is accredited.
        Prior to enrolling, itâ€™s important to determine whether or not your
        field of study requires accreditation for employment and/or licensing.
