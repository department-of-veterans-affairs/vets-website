    <p>
      The Yellow Ribbon Program can help you pay for out-of-state, private
      school, or graduate school tuition that the Post-9/11 GI Bill doesn’t
      cover. Schools that choose to participate in the Yellow Ribbon program
      will contribute a certain amount toward the extra tuition. VA will match
      the participating school’s contribution, up to the total cost of the
      tuition and fees.
