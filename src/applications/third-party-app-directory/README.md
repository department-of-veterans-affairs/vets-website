# Third Party App Directory

## Development

The third party app directory is built as a React widget that is lazy loaded onto a static template generated by Drupal. In order to run and test changes to the app directory you'll need to run the following [commands](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website#building-static-content):

```sh
yarn build:content --pull-drupal
```

After the build process is complete you should run the preview server concurrently with the webpack server

```sh
yarn preview
```

then

```sh
yarn watch
```

## Running tests

To run all unit tests for the app directory you can run the following:

```sh
yarn test:unit src/applications/third-party-app-directory/**/*.unit.spec.js*
```
