                  Access to all your VA benefits, services, and information in a

                Here’s the difference between these 2 accounts:
                <br />
                Login.gov is an account created, maintained, and secured by the
                U.S. government. It encrypts your stored information at 2
                levels. Encryption translates your data into code that only you
                can access as the account holder. This means only you can access
                and change your information.
                <br />
                ID.me is an account created, maintained, and secured by a
                trusted technology partner. It uses bank-grade encryption to
                keep your personal information safe. It gives you control over
                which services can share your information.

              <p>
                You need to start using a verified account by{' '}
                {MHV_TRANSITION_DATE}. After this date, you’ll no longer be able
                to use your My HealtheVet username and password to sign in to My
                HealtheVet or VA.gov.

              <h3>Why do I need to start using a verified account?</h3>
              <p>
                We have new, stronger security requirements to help keep your
                personal information safe. These requirements come from the
                National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). With
                these requirements, everyone must verify their identity to
                access any information about their U.S. government benefits
                online.
              </p>
              <p>Here’s what this means for you:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When you create your new account, the account provider will
                  verify your identity. They’ll ask you for personal information
                  (like a photo ID) to make sure you’re you and not someone
                  pretending to be you. This helps us keep your personal
                  information safe.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each time you sign in with a verified account, you’ll need to
                  provide your password plus a second way to verify you’re you
                  (like a one-time code or an authentication app). This helps us
                  make sure that it’s you trying to access your account—and not
                  a hacker.
