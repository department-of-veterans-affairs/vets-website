                  Sign in to {siteName} with either your existing My HealtheVet
                  or DS Logon account (the same one you use for eBenefits or
                  MilConnect) or an ID.me account.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you don’t have an account on {siteName}, you can create one
                  using ID.me, our Veteran-owned, trusted technology partner
                  that provides the strongest identity verification system
                  available.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you’re signed in, we can verify your identity to make
                  sure you’re you. This also helps to keep your information
                  safe, and prevent fraud and identity theft.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Verifying your identity is a one-time process that’ll take
                  about 5-10 minutes. Once you’ve gone through the
                  identity-proofing process, you won't need to do it again. To
                  verify your identity through ID.me, you’ll need:

                  You can complete the application without signing in, but it’ll
                  take us longer to verify your identity. This will delay a
                  decision on your application. The fastest way to get your
                  application processed is to sign in with a My HealtheVet, DS
                  Logon, or ID.me account.

                    this, you’ll need to use ID.me, our Veteran-owned, trusted
                    technology partner that provides the strongest identity
                    verification system available.

                    If you signed in using your My HealtheVet or DS Logon
                    account, we’ll connect your account to {siteName} through
                    ID.me. To verify your identity through ID.me, you’ll need:
