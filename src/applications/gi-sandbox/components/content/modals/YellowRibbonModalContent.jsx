    <h3>Yellow Ribbon Program</h3>
    <p>
      The Yellow Ribbon Program can help you pay for out-of-state, private
      school, or graduate school tuition that the Post-9/11 GI Bill doesn’t
      cover. Schools that choose to participate in the Yellow Ribbon program
      will contribute a certain amount toward the extra tuition. VA will match
      the participating school’s contribution, up to the total cost of the
      tuition and fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Veterans and Fry Scholarship and Purple Heart recipients, or their
      dependents using transferred benefits, are eligible for the maximum
      benefit rate. Active-duty service members and their spouses aren’t
      eligible for this program. (An active-duty service member’s dependent
      child using transferred benefits may be eligible if the service member is
      qualified at the 100% rate.)
