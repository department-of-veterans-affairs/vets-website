      <h3>GI Bill students</h3>
      <p>
        The number of Veterans, service members and family members using their
        GI Bill benefits attending this school in the last calendar year. This
        includes all chapters of the GI Bill program (e.g., Post-9/11,
        Montgomery GI Bill, Reserve Education Assistance Program, and Veteran
        Readiness and Employment). Keep in mind that differences in attendee
        numbers donâ€™t necessarily mean one school is more military friendly than
        another. This information will be updated annually.
