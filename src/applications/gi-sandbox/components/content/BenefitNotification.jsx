      <p>
        Under the Forever GI Bill, the Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) is
        calculated based on the campus location where you physically attend the
        majority of your classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To estimate your MHA benefit, you can go to a school or employer's
        profile page in the GI Bill Comparison Tool and answer the question
        "Where will you take the majority of your classes?"
