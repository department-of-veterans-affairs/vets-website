 *
 * The back-end is expecting an array of objects.  However, it is not
 * expecting an object per enrollemnt period, rather, it expects one
 * enrollment per status. When multiple months are marked as valid,
 * one object with _the most recent enrollment_ information used for the
 * end/through date is expected.  If some months are marked as valid and
 * a later month is marked as invalid, two objects would be send: one
 * for the valid month(s) and one for the invalid month.
 *
 * So, in the case where The Veteran is sumitting a verification for 3
 * months (e.g. January, February, and March) and the first two months
 * were marked as valid, an array with two objects would be returned:
 * 1. one object with a correct response type and end/through date of
 *    2/28/2022; and
 * 2. a second object with an incorrect reaponse type and end/through
 *    date of 3/31/2022.
 *
 * Given the same 3 months, if all three were marked as correct, an
 * array of one object would be sent with a correct response type and
 * an end/thorugh date of 3/31/2022.

 * Given the same 3 months, if January were marked as correct, Febuary
 * and March would not be able to be validated an array of one object
 * would be sent with an incorrect response type and an end/thorugh
 * date of 1/31/2022.
 *
