      <p>
        You have the right to dispute all or part of your VA copay charges.
        Write a letter explaining why you think the copay charges or balance
        amount may not be correct. To avoid late charges, youâ€™ll need to dispute
        the debt within 30 days of receiving your bill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mail the letter, or bring it in person, to the business office or health
        administration office at your nearest VA medical center. If you send
        your dispute by mail, please include "Billing Dispute" on the mailing
        envelope.
