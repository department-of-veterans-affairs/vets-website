        Our chatbot is a resource to help you quickly find information about VA
        benefits and services. You won’t communicate with an actual
        representative through the chatbot. If you need help with any of the
        issues listed here, you’ll need to speak with a health care professional
        or one of our representatives. You can also visit our resources and
        support section for more information.
