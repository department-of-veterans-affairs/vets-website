      <h2>Can I get a VA home loan COE?</h2>
      <p>
        You may be able to get a COE if you didn’t receive a dishonorable
        discharge and you meet the minimum active-duty service requirement based
        on when you served.

        You can also request a VA home loan COE through your lender or by mail
      </h3>
      <p>
        In some cases, you can get your COE through your lender using our WebLGY
        system. Ask your lender about this option.
      </p>
      <p>
        To request a COE by mail, fill out a Request for a Certificate of
        Eligibility (VA Form 26-1880) and mail it to the address listed on the
        form. Please keep in mind that this may take longer than requesting a
        COE online or through our WebLGY system.
