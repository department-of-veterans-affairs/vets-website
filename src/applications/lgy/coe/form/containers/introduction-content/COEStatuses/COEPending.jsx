          No. We’re reviewing your current request, and submitting a new request
          won’t affect our decision or speed up the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          If more than 5 business days have passed since you submitted your
          request and you haven’t heard back, please don’t apply again. Call our
          toll-free number at <Telephone contact="8778273702" />.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only time you’d need to apply again is if our VA home loan case
          management team recommends that you do this.
