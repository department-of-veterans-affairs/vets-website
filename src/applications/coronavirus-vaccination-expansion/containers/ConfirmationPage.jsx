        <h2>We've received your information</h2>
        <p>
          Thank you for signing up to get a COVID-19 vaccine at VA. When we have
          new information to share about our COVID-19 plans and your vaccine
          options, we'll send you updates by email or text.
        </p>
        <h2>When can I get a COVID-19 at VA?</h2>
        <p>
          At this time, some VA health facilities have a limited amount of
          vaccines. We’re working to determine how quickly we can begin to offer
          vaccines to people other than Veterans who are already enrolled in VA
          health care. This may vary by facility. Some facilities may be able to
          offer vaccines to these groups now, while others may not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your employer, pharmacy, health care provider’s office, or local
          public health officials may offer you a COVID-19 vaccine. We encourage
          you to take the first opportunity you have to get a vaccine at the
          most convenient location for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> Your safety is our priority. Please don't come
          to a VA health facility to request a COVID-19 vaccine unless you have
          an appointment or received an invite to a vaccine clinic.
        </p>
        <h2>How will VA contact me when I can get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h2>
        <p>
          Your closest VA health facility may contact you by phone, email, or
          text message. If you’re eligible and want to get a vaccine, we
          encourage you to respond.
        </p>
        <p>
          But before you provide any personal information or click on any links,
          be sure the call, email, or text is really from VA.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Text messages will always come from <strong>53079</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Emails will always come from a <strong>va.gov</strong> email
            address.
          </li>
          <li>
            If someone calls you from VA and you don’t recognize the phone
            number, ask for a number to call them back. Then call the VA health
            facility to verify.{' '}
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your facility may invite you to get a vaccine in different ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            They may invite you to a large vaccination event, like a drive-thru
            clinic.
          </li>
          <li>They may offer you a specific date and time to get a vaccine.</li>
          <li>They may ask you to schedule an appointment.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>If I’m a Veteran, how can I apply for VA health care?</h2>
        <p>
          First, you’ll need to find out if you’re eligible based on your
          service history or other factors. If you’re eligible, you can apply
          online.
