    <h2>Privacy Act Statement</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Privacy Act Notice:</strong> Public Law 117-4 authorizes VA to
      provide COVID-19 vaccines to certain eligible Veterans, spouses of
      eligible Veterans, certain caregivers of Veterans, and certain recipients
      of CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of
      Veterans Affairs) benefits. VA is asking you to provide the information on
      this form in order for VA to register you for a vaccine. This form will be
      used to collect information from certain persons interested in receiving a
      COVID-19 vaccine administered by VA. Providing the requested information
      is voluntary, but if any or all of the requested information is not
      provided, it may delay or result in denial of your request for
      vaccination. If you provide VA your Social Security Number, VA will use it
      to administer this benefit. Any information provided by applicants,
      recipients, and others may be subject to verification through computer
      matching programs with other agencies. VA may disclose the information
      that you put on the form as permitted by law. VA may make a “routine use”
      disclosure of the information as outlined in the Privacy Act systems of
      records notices and in accordance with the VHA Notice of Privacy
      Practices.
