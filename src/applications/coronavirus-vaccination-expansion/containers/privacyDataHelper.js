    <h2>Privacy Act Statement</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Privacy Act Notice:</strong> Public Law 117-4 authorizes VA to
      provide COVID-19 vaccines to certain eligible Veterans, spouses of
      eligible Veterans, certain caregivers of Veterans, and certain recipients
      of CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of
      Veterans Affairs) benefits. VA is asking you to provide the information on
      this form in order for VA to determine your eligibility for vaccination
      under the law. This form will be used to collect information from certain
      persons interested in receiving a COVID-19 vaccine from VA and to
      determine eligibility for a COVID-19 vaccine administered by VA. Providing
      the requested information is voluntary, but if any or all of the requested
      information is not provided, it may delay or result in denial of your
      request for vaccination. If you provide VA your Social Security Number, VA
      will use it to administer this benefit. Any information provided by
      applicants, recipients, and others may be subject to verification through
      computer matching programs with other agencies. VA may disclose the
      information that you put on the form as permitted by law. VA may make a
      “routine use” disclosure of the information as outlined in the Privacy Act
      systems of records notices and in accordance with the VHA Notice of
      Privacy Practices.
