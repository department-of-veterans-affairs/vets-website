    <h2>Privacy Act Statement</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Privacy Act Notice:</strong> Public Law 117-4 authorizes VA to
      provide COVID-19 vaccines to certain eligible Veterans, spouses of
      eligible Veterans, certain caregivers of Veterans, and certain receipients
      of CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of
      Veterans Affairs) benefits. This form will be used to collect certain
      information from interested persons interested in receiving a COVID-19
      vaccine from VA and determine eligibility for a COVID-19 vaccine
      administered by VA. If eligibility is determined, a medical may be created
      if the applicant does not have an existing medical record. The responses
      you submit are considered confidential (38 U.S.C. 5701). Any information
      provided by applicants, recipients, and others may be subject to
      verification through computer matching programs with other agencies.
