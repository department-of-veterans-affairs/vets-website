          We use your last year&#8217;s household income, minus certain
          deductions, to determine your VA health care eligibility and costs.
          Select your income range to find out how your income may affect your
          eligibility and costs. But remember, the only way to know for sure is
          to apply.
        </p>
        <p>How to estimate your household income range:</p>
        <ul>

            jobs and other sources. Your household includes you and your spouse

            Then subtract any deductions you had in {previousYear}. You can
            deduct some health care costs you didn&#8217;t get paid back for,
            expenses for your own college or vocational training, and any
            funeral or burial expenses for a spouse or dependent child.
