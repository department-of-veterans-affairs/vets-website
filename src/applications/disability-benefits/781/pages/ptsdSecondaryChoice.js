      The following questions will help us understand more about your
      [PTSDclassification]-related PTSD. None of the questions we‘ll ask you are
      required, but any information you provide here will help us research your
      claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have already completed a Claim for Service Connection for
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (VA Form 21-0781), you can upload it here
      instead of answering the questions about your PTSD.
    </p>
    <p>How would you like to provide information about your PTSD?</p>

      If you choose to answer questions, we‘ll ask you several questions to
      learn more about your PTSD.

      If you upload a completed VA Form 21-0781a, we won‘t ask you questions
