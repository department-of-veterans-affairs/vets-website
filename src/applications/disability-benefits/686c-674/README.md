# Background
From time to time Veterans need to make updates to the dependents they get benefits for. These updates can be when a divorce happens, or a death, or a new child is born, etc. The 686c form is how these changes to dependents are made.

## How the form works for the user 

Since the Veteran may be making any one of various changes to dependents, there are multiple path, or workflows, they can take through the form. When the veteran starts the form they are shown an introduction page with some information about what is in the form. Then they are taken to a "wizard" page where they can choose what workflow they want to take though the form.
