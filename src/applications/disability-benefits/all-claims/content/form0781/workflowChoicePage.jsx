      <h4>When to consider adding VA Form 21-0781 to your claim.</h4>
      <p>
        We offer this optional form for you to share more supporting information
        about certain conditions. If your claim includes a new mental health
        condition (like PTSD, major depression, or generalized anxiety disorder)
        that’s related to a traumatic event you experienced during military
        service, we encourage you to submit this form.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll need to ask you about the traumatic events you experienced and any
        behavioral changes that you experienced as a result. Answer as many or
        as few of the questions that you feel comfortable answering. We’ll use
        any information you can share to support your claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        To answer all the questions, you’ll likely need about 45 minutes. You
        can answer the questions online. Or, you can fill out a PDF version of
        the form and upload it as part of your online submission.
