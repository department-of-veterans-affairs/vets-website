      The next few questions are about behavioral changes you experienced after
      your traumatic experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      These questions are optional. Any information you provide will help us
      understand your situation and identify evidence to support your claim. You
      can provide only details you’re comfortable sharing.
    </p>
    <h4>Information we’ll ask you for</h4>
    <p>
      We’ll ask you for this information:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The types of behavioral changes you experienced after your traumatic
          events
        </li>
        <li>
          A description of each behavioral change, including when it happened,
          whether any records exist, and any other details you want to provide
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>You can take a break at any time</h4>
    <p>
      We understand that some of the questions may be difficult to answer. You
      can take a break at any time and come back to continue your application
      later. We’ll save the information you’ve entered so far.

      these questions are optional. You don’t need to answer them. If we need
