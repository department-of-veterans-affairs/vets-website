  <p>
    The amount you get for VA compensation may be reduced or withheld if you’re
    also receiving severance or separation pay. This includes medical separation
    pay or any money you get from the Voluntary Separation Incentive (VSI)
    program. Getting VA compensation pay and separation pay at the same time may
    mean that we’ve paid you too much, and you may need to repay the money.

    The amount you get for VA compensation may be reduced or withheld if you’re
    also receiving active or inactive duty training pay. To keep your training
    pay you must waive VA compensation pay for the same number of days you
    receive training pay. Getting VA compensation pay and training pay at the
    same time may mean that we've paid you too much, and you may need to repay
    the money.
