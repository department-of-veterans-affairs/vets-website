    The amount you get for VA compensation may be reduced or withheld if you’re
    also receiving severance or separation pay. This includes medical separation
    pay or any money you get from the Voluntary Separation Incentive (VSI)
    program. Getting VA compensation pay and separation pay at the same time may
    mean that we’ve paid you too much, and you may need to repay the money.
