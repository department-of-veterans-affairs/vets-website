    The amount you get for VA compensation may be reduced or withheld if you’re
    also receiving severance or separation pay. This includes medical
    separation pay or any money you get from the Voluntary Separation Incentive
    (VSI) program. Getting VA compensation pay and separation pay at the same
    time may mean that we’ve paid you too much, and you may need to repay the
    money.

    The amount you get for VA compensation may be reduced or withheld if you’re
    also receiving active or inactive duty training pay. To keep your training
    pay you must waive VA compensation pay for the same number of days you
    receive training pay. Getting VA compensation pay and training pay at the
    same time may mean that we've paid you too much, and you may need to repay
    the money.
