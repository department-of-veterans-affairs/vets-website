      Now we’re going to ask you questions about changes in your physical,
      mental, professional and social behavior as a result of the event or
      events. You may have experienced some of these or none of them. There’s
      space at the end of these questions for you to add comments or describe
      other changes in behavior you’d like us to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please identify any changes in your physical health as a result of the
      event(s). (Check any that apply.)
