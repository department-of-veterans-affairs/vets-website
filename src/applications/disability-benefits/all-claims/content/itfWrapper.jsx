      <strong>What an intent to file means: </strong>
      <p className="vads-u-font-size--base">
        An intent to file sets a potential start date (or effective date) for
        your benefits. You then have up to 1 year to complete and file your
        claim. And you may be able to get retroactive payments (payments for the
        time between when you submitted your intent to file and when we approved
        your claim).
      </p>
      <br />
      <strong>What you can do next:</strong>
      <p className="vads-u-font-size--base">
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can continue and submit your claim online today—or when you’re
            ready. If we don’t have an intent to file on record for this claim
            that’s within the past year, we’ll use the date you submit your
            claim as a potential start date for your benefits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Or you can call us to confirm if you have an intent to file for this
