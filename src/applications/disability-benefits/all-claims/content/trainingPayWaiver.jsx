    If you’re eligible for both training pay and VA compensation, you’ll need to
    decide which one you want to get. You can’t get VA compensation for the same
    days you get training pay. If you want to keep your training pay, you’ll
    need to waive (or tell us you don’t want to get) VA compensation pay for the
    days you receive training pay.
