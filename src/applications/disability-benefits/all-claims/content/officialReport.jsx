        When reporting a sexual assault during military service, two different
        reporting options are given. Restricted reporting are reports made while
        requesting confidentiality. Unrestricted reporting are reports made
        without requesting confidentiality. These options were not available
        before 2005.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re not sure which reports were filed, VA may send a follow up
        letter with additional information.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s OK if no official reports were filed for this event. We understand
        that traumatic events often go unreported. You can skip this question if
        you don’t feel comfortable answering.
