        If you have other evidence, such as a lay or buddy statement to turn in,
        you can upload them here. You can upload your document in a pdf, .jpeg, or
        .png file format. You’ll first need to scan a copy of your document onto
        your computer or mobile phone. You can then upload the document from there.
        Please note that if you have a slow Internet connection, large files can
        take longer to upload.

      <p>File upload guidelines:</p>

        <li>Maximum file size: 50 MB</li>
      </ul>
