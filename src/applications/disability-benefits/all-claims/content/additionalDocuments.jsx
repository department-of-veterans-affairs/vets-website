      If you have other evidence, such as a lay or buddy statement to turn in,
      you can upload them here. You can upload your document in a pdf, .jpeg, or
      .png file format. Youâ€™ll first need to scan a copy of your document onto
      your computer or mobile phone. You can then upload the document from
      there. Please note that if you have a slow Internet connection, large
      files can take longer to upload.
    </p>
    <p>File upload guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>File types you can upload: .pdf, .jpeg, or .png</li>
      <li>Files can be a maximum of 50MB each</li>
