      The amount you get for VA disability compensation may be reduced or
      withheld if you’re also receiving military retirement, separation,
      severance, or training pay. You can’t receive benefits for more than one
      program at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next few screens, we’ll ask you if you’re receiving another type
      of service pay. If you’re receiving service pay, we’ll then ask you if
      you want to waive VA disability compensation pay so you can continue to
      receive another type of service pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that VA disability compensation pay isn’t taxable, so in some
      cases, it may be the greater benefit.
