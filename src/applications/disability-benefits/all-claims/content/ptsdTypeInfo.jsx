      or hostile unit or weapon. It also could mean you were present during

      combatants -- for example, providing medical care to the wounded.
    </p>
    <h5>Sexual trauma</h5>
    <p>
      This means you experienced sexual harassment, sexual assault, or rape, by
      a Servicemember or civilian, while on active duty, active duty for
      training, or inactive duty training.
    </p>
    <h5>Personal assault</h5>

      This means you were a victim of an assault, battery, robbery, mugging,
      stalking, or harassment by a person who wasn't part of an enemy force.
    </p>
    <h5>Non-combat PTSD other than sexual trauma or personal assault</h5>

      This means you experienced an event such as a car accident, hurricane, or
      plane crash, or witnessed the death, injury, or threat to another person
      or to yourself, that was caused by something other than a hostile military
      or terrorist activity.
