    <p>
      This means you experienced sexual harassment, sexual assault, or rape, by
      a service member or civilian, while on active duty, active duty for
      training, or inactive duty training.
    </p>
    <h4 className="vads-u-font-size--h5">Personal assault</h4>
    <p>

      stalking, or harassment by a person who wasn't part of an enemy force.
    </p>
    <h4 className="vads-u-font-size--h5">
