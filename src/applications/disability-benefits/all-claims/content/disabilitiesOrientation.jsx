      On the next few screens, we’ll ask you about the disabilities you’re claiming in two parts.

        Your rated service-connected disabilities, if you have any. (Please note,
        if you don’t have any rated disabilities, you won’t see this screen.)
      </li>
      <li>Your new service-connected disabilities or conditions</li>

      Once we have your list of disabilities, we’ll ask you more specific
      questions about each of them.
