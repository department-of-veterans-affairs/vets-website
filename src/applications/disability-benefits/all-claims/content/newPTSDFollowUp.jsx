      If you’re filing a claim for PTSD, you’ll need to provide additional
      documents and details about the traumatic (or “stressor”) event that
      caused your PTSD. You may also need to provide treatment records and
      contact information for any relevant supporting statements.
    </p>

      If you need more time to prepare your evidence for your PTSD claim, you
      can save your application and return to it later when you have your
      evidence ready to upload.
