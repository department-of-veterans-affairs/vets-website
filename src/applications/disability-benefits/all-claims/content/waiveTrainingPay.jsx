    The amount you get for VA compensation may be reduced or withheld if youâ€™re
    also receiving active or inactive duty training pay. To keep your training
    pay you must waive VA compensation pay for the same number of days you
    receive training pay. Getting VA compensation pay and training pay at the
    same time may mean that we've paid you too much, and you may need to repay
    the money.
