    If you decide to receive VA compensation pay, it may reduce the amount you
    get for retirement pay. <strong>VA compensation isn’t taxable, so it may be
    the greater benefit.</strong> If you choose to not receive VA compensation
    pay so you can continue to get retirement pay, any VA compensation payments
    you’re already getting will stop, and you won’t get any more from this
    application.
