      You can upload your document in a .pdf, .jpeg, or .png file format. Youâ€™ll
      first need to scan a copy of your document onto your computer or mobile
      phone. You can then upload the document from there.
      <br />
      Guidelines for uploading a file:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>File types you can upload: .pdf, .jpeg, or .png</li>
      <li>Maximum file size: 25MB</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <em>
        A 1MB file equals about 500 pages of text. A photo is usually about 6MB.
        Large files can take longer to upload with a slow Internet connection.
