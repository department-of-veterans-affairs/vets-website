      You may be eligible for additional disability compensation or benefits to
      help with special claims like the ones listed below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adapting your home or vehicle to make it more accessible</li>
      <li>
        Home-based care if you need help with everyday activities or are
        housebound because of your service-connected disability
      </li>
      <li>
        Individual Unemployability if your service-connected disability prevents
        you from holding down a steady job
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We’ll ask you a few questions about these situations to see if they apply
      to you. If you’re eligible for these additional benefits, you’ll need to
      download and fill out additional forms to apply.
