        If you don’t know the name of your condition or aren’t finding a match,
        you can type in your symptoms and we’ll help you figure out the name of
        your condition during the exam process.

      <ul>
        <li>My knee hurts when I walk.</li>
        <li>I have trouble hearing when other people talk.</li>
        <li>My doctor says my cancer may be related to my service.</li>
      </ul>
