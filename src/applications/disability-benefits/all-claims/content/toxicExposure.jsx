        We want to make sure you get any disability benefits you may be eligible
        for.
      </p>
      <p>
        We automatically assume (or “presume”) that certain toxic exposures
        during military service cause certain health conditions. We call these
        “presumptive conditions.”
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a presumptive condition, you don’t need to prove that your
        service caused the condition to get VA disability compensation. You only
        need to meet the minimum service requirements for the presumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recent PACT Act law has many added presumptive conditions and
        locations for toxic exposures.
