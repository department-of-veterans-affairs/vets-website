          Your place of anticipated separation is where you expect to separate
          from military service. This could be your last active-duty base or the
          nearest regional facility that handles separations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ask for this location so we can more easily gather details, such as
          your exact separation date, to help process your claim.
        </p>
