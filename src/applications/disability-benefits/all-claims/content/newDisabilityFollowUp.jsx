            To be eligible for service-connected disability benefits, you’ll
            need to show that your disability was caused by an event, injury, or
            disease during your military service. You’ll need to show your
            condition is linked to your service by submitting evidence, such as
            medical reports or lay statements, with your claim. We may ask you
            to have a claim exam if you don’t submit evidence or if we need more
            information to decide your claim.
