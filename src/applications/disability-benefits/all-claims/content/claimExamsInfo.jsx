        You’ll receive a phone call from a VA third-party vendor or from VA to
        schedule your exam. It’s important that you answer any calls you receive
        after you file a disability claim.

          If we can’t reach you by phone, we’ll schedule an appointment for you.
          We’ll send you a letter with the date and time of your exam.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please call the number on your appointment letter to confirm your exam
          time and location.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can’t make your appointment, let us know right away. You can
          most likely reschedule, but this may delay your claim.

        <p>
          Not everyone who files a disability claim will need an exam. We’ll ask
          you to have an exam only if we need more information to decide your
          claim.
