      After we review your disability claim and supporting evidence, we may ask
      you to have a claim exam (also known as a C&amp;P exam) if we need more
      information to decide your claim.

      <p>
        If we can't reach you by phone, we'll schedule an appointment for you.
        We'll send you a letter with the date and time of your exam.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please call the number on your appointment letter to confirm your exam
        time and location.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you can't make your appointment, let us know right away. You can most
        likely reschedule, but this may delay your claim.

      <p>
        Not everyone who files a disability claim will need an exam. We’ll ask
        you to have an exam only if we need more information to decide your
        claim and to help us rate your disability.
