    <p>
      When you file a claim for Individual Unemployability, you'll have a chance
      to provide supporting documents that show your disability prevents you
      from holding down a steady job.
    </p>
    <p>Some examples of supporting documents include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Medical records</li>
      <li>Social Security Administration Disability Determination</li>
      <li>Termination letters from past employers</li>
      <li>Supporting statements from coworkers or colleagues</li>
      <li>Absentee reports</li>
      <li>Your personal journal, diaries, or calendars</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do you have supporting documents youâ€™d like to upload?</p>
