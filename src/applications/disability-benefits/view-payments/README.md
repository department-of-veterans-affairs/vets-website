# Background
Veterans receive lots of payments for the various benefits they receive from the VA. This app allows Veterans to see what payments have been made to them as well as some basic information about those payments.

## How the app works for the user
When the user lands on the View Payments page they will either have payments or not. If they have no payments they will be shown a message that we have no payments on file for them. If they do have payments they will be shown a list of all the payments we have on file for them. If the user does have payments they will be split into two lists, one is payments that the Veteran has received, the second is payments that have been returned to the VA.

The page also includes some static content about payments with helpful links.

> There is a third possibility when the user lands on the page, that we had an error looking up their payments. If there is an error they will be shown a message about the error.

## The front end code
> This is for a detailed description of the front end code for your app. Good things to put here are the basic folder and file structure as well as a short description of why this folder and file structure was used. Also be sure to callout any interesting folder or file usage that might confuse a future developer.

## Callouts on how the front end works
> Any special or interesting aspects of how the front end works should be detailed here. This is meant to be read by developers that need to make sense of these special or interesting aspects of your code without you present so write them with as much code detail as possible to achieve good clarity.
