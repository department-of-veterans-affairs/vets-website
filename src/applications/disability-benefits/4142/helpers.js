    <h5>Upload your medical records</h5>
    <p>
      If you have an electronic copy of your medical records, uploading your
      records can speed up the review of your claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      This works best if you have a fast internet connection and time for a
      large file upload. Records should be .pdf, .jpg, or .png files and can be
      up to 50MB each.
    </p>
    <h5>We get records for you</h5>
    <p>
      If you tell us which VA medical center treated you for your condition, we
      can get your medical reocrds for you. Getting your records may take us
      some time. This could take us longer to make a decision on your claim.

    <h3>Types of evidence</h3>
    <h4>VA medical records</h4>
    <p>
      If you were treated at a VA medical center or clinic, or by a doctor
      through the TRICARE health care program, you’ll have VA medical records.
    </p>
    <h4>Private medical records</h4>
    <p>
      If you were treated by a private doctor, including a Veteran’s Choice
      doctor, you’ll have private medical records. We’ll need to see those
      records to make a decision on your claim. A Disability Benefit
      Questionnaire is an example of a private medical record.
    </p>
    <h4>Lay statements or other evidence</h4>
    <p>
      A lay statement is a written statement from family, friends, or coworkers
      to help support your claim. Lay statements are also called “buddy
      statements.” In most cases, you’ll only need your medical records to
      support your disability claim. Some claims, for example, for Posttraumatic
      Stress Disorder or for military sexual trauma, could benefit from a lay or
      buddy statement.
