      To request a Higher-Level Review, you’ll need to opt out (withdraw) from
      the old appeals process. This switch triggers us to formally withdraw your
      claim or appeal from the old appeal system and process it under the new
      system. Once you opt in to the new appeals process, the decision is
      permanent and you can’t return to the old appeals process.
