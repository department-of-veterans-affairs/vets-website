      YOU SHOULD NOT COMPLETE THIS FORM UNLESS YOU WANT THE VA TO OBTAIN PRIVATE
      TREATMENT RECORDS ON YOUR BEHALF. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED THESE
      RECORDS OR INTEND TO OBTAIN THEM YOURSELF, THERE IS NO NEED TO FILL OUT
      THIS FORM. DOING SO WILL LENGTHEN YOUR CLAIM PROCESSING TIME.

    <h4>IMPORTANT:</h4>
    <p>
      In accordance with 38 C.F.R. §3.159(c), "VA will not pay any fees charged
      by a custodian to provide records requested."
    </p>
    <h4>PATIENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:</h4>
    <p>
      I HEREBY AUTHORIZE the sources listed in Section IV, to release any
      information that may have been obtained in connection with a physical,
      psychological or psychiatric examination or treatment, with the
      understanding that VA will use this information in determining my
      eligibility to veterans benefits I have claimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that the source being asked to provide the Veterans Benefits
      Administration with records under this authorization may not require me to
      execute this authorization before it provides me with treatment, payment
      for health care, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits
      provided by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that once my source sends this information to VA under this
      authorization, the information will no longer be protected by the HIPAA
      Privacy Rule, but will be protected by the Federal Privacy Act, 5 USC
      552a, and VA may disclose this information as authorized by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also understand that I may revoke this authorization in writing, at any
      time except to the extent a source of information has already relied on it
      to take an action. To revoke, I must send a written statement to the VA
      Regional Office handling my claim or the Board of Veterans' Appeals (if my
      claim is related to an appeal) and also send a copy directly to any of my
      sources that I no longer wish to disclose information about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that VA may use information disclosed prior to revocation to
      decide my claim.
