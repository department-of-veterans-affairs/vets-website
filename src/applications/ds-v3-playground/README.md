## va-file-input-multiple (File uploads)

The `va-file-input-multiple` example in this app demonstrates the multiple-file upload component if the component was used outside of the forms-system.

The example is a recommendation and not a required approach. Implementation of the file input component is flexible and can be adapted to your specific needs.
