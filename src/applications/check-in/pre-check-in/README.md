# Pre Check in Application

## Description

This is the pre-check-in application. Ideally, this is going to be filled out days before the appointment. The veteran will be able to confirm various aspects of their appointment and information.

From a technical perspective, this app is going to be very similar to the the `day-of` product. For this iteration we are going to be focusing on creating a dynamic form system using the new Formulate library. The Formulate library is not yet ready for prime time, but we will be using the underlying engine (Formik), for when we need edit data points.

The goal one day is to merge the two applications together.

### What version of the api are we using?

What we know

- Using v2 of the api for low auth
- using a new route to get the demographics
- POSTing to a new route to send to CHIP that the pre-checkin was complete

### How to run locally

Follow the standard directions to run the app. The API needs to be running in order to run the app locally. Currently I would use the mock api in `src/applications/pre-check-in/api/local-mock-api` using the directions in the [README](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/README.md#running-a-mock-api-for-local-development). This makes development easier since creating a valid token is tedious.

### Enable local type checking with jsconfig (Optional)

The `utils` directory of the check-in application contains JSDoc comments to improve editor feedback and autocomplete functionality. To enable advanced type checking, copy the `jsconfig-example.json` file in the root of the check-in folder and rename it to be `jsconfig.json`. The new file will automatically be excluded form the git repo by the gitignore file.

Note that JSDoc comments are only included when the editor cannot not correctly infer types. Any objects, function arguments, or return types that can be successfully inferred from the code are not necessary.

### How to run with Codespaces

#### Setup

[Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) is available for VA project development, and provides a convenient way to create a functional environment for testing a branch or collaborative review. To set up a codespace, follow the [instructions here](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/Using-GitHub-Codespaces.1909063762.html). (Note that you can lower the setup time to ~6-7 minutes by creating a setting on your Github account to skip the content build) You may then run the app locally using Codespace's default port forwarding setup.

#### Public sharing

To share an app instance using the mock API running on Codespaces publicly, use these steps:

- Create the codespace as above and wait for it to build
- Start the mock API in a Codespace terminal: `yarn mock-api --responses path/to/mock/api.js`
- Start the app in another Codespace terminal: `yarn watch --env.api="https://${CODESPACE_NAME}-3000.githubpreview.dev" --env.entry pre-check-in`
- Go to the "Ports" tab and make both port 3000 and 3001 public by right-clicking and selecting Privacy -> Public:

- Hover over the "Local Address" on the line for port 3001 and click the globe icon to open the public URL in your browser.

### Where is the data coming from?

- Demographics and Appointment data are coming from VistA.

### What API(s) does this use?

// TODO: fill this doc in with ticket number<https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/32743>

### Feature toggles

We are currently using an HOC located at `src/applications/pre-check-in/containers/withFeatureFlip.jsx` to control the feature flips. The whole app is wrapped around one, and each new feature should have its own toggle.

Though we have the HOC, its now considered best practice to query redux using the useSelector hook.

#### Current toggles

- `check_in_experience_pre_check_in_enabled` : Enables or disabled the whole app on va.gov
  - when to sunset: never;
- `check_in_experience_translation_disclaimer_spanish_enabled` : Enables or disables the mixed language disclaimer (there may be some untranslated content) for spanish pages of the site
  - when to sunset: when we are in a situation where new content is not added to the site until it is translated into spanish
- `check_in_experience_browser_monitoring`: Enables browser monitoring for check-in applications.
- `check_in_experience_pre_check_in_action_link_top_placement`: Changes pre-check-in action link placement to the top of the page.

### How to test this?

Each feature should have unit tests and e2e tests.

For testing in staging, use the instructions at [https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/engineering/qa/test-data-setup.md](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/engineering/qa/test-data-setup.md).

### Useful acronym and terms

- CHIP - New API that is a central point for all the health data access. Bascially a wrapper around VistA and other internal nasty APIs.
- LoROTA - Low Risk Authorization Service. This is how we are managing and verifying a user is who they say they are. Currently its a token based system that is essentially a shared short term data storage
- VeText - This is the service that sends and receives text messages for the user.
- VistA - This is a legacy but powerful health recond system that the VA uses. This is slowly being replace by Cerner.
- VA Profile - This is the universal profile service that is used to store veteran data.
- Check-In - The day of check in applicatipn
- Pre-Check-In - The forms that a user can fill out before they check in.
- Pre-registration - This the confirmation that a user needs to do before their appointment, this can be day of, or days before

### Error handling

All errors are stored as strings in Redux state. When an error occurs in a component all that is done in that component is to call the `updateError` method from the `useUpdateError` hook.

```
try {
  *something*
} catch (error) {
  updateError('error-completing-pre-check-in');
}
```
This architecture separates the error logic from the component that throws the error so that it does not need not be concerned with how to handle the error just with what type of error occured. which results in dryer code if the same error is thrown from different components in the application.

Next, an error type represented by a string is passed to the `updateError` method which dispatches `setError` which stores the error type string in the Redux state.
```
const updateError = useCallback(
  error => {
    dispatch(setError(error));
  },
  [dispatch],
);
```
Later this could include more robust error reporting using GA, Sentry or Datadog. This also give us the flexibility to create other side effects like add more information to the state object for more complicated error messaging based on the error type.

There is a higher order component called `withError` that selects the error and if there is one routes to the Error page using the `goToErrorPage` utility where logic on the error page components display the proper error messaging.
```
useEffect(
  () => {
    if (error) {
      goToErrorPage(error);
    }
  },
  [error],
);

```
The router utility goToErrorPage will use the error string to add a query string to the url for GA tracking. This gives us more flexibility to get creative with the URL parameters.
