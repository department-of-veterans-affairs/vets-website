## Good to knows

### Project URLS

```markdown
/family-member-benefits/apply-for-caregiver-assistance-form-10-10cg/introduction
```

### How to run locally

Follow the standard directions to run the app. The API needs to be running in order to run the app locally.

### Where is the data going?

The data is ultimately going to a system called CARMA (Caregiver Record Management Application). The `vets-api` backend sends the data to MuleSoft, which then sends it on to CARMA.

### VA Forms

We are using version 1 of the forms library, Formation. This is a straight forward standard form. We are using [the vets-json-schema](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema) to validate the shape of the data.

### What API(s) does this use?

This uses the Caregivers API, the main controller is [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/app/controllers/v0/caregivers_assistance_claims_controller.rb).

- [`/v0/caregivers_assistance_claims`](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/api-reference/#/benefits_forms/post_v0_caregivers_assistance_claims) - Form submission API
- [`/v0/form1010cg/attachments`](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/api-reference/#/default/post_v0_form1010cg_attachments) - File upload API for power of attorney documents
- [`/v0/caregivers_assistance_claims/facilities`](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/api-reference/#/benefits_forms/post_v0_caregivers_assistance_claims_facilities) - Retrieve a list of active healthcare facilities
- [`/v0/caregivers_assistance_claims/download_pdf`](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/api-reference/#/benefits_forms/post_v0_caregivers_assistance_claims_download_pdf) - Download a pre-filled 10-10CG PDF form upon submission receipt.

### Feature toggles

- We have a feature toggle (`caregiver_use_facilities_API`) to enable turning off the VA Lighthouse integration and instead use a static list in case of a VA Lighthouse API outage.
- We have a feature toggle (`caregiver_browser_monitoring_enabled`) to enable DataDog's browser monitoring for the application

### How to test new features?

Currently, there are no lower environments for CARMA. We are currently working through that problem.

Each feature should have unit tests and e2e tests. Since this is an unauthenticated form, we use teh Review Instances to review before merging a PR.
