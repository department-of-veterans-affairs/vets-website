      First, we need to know if the Veteran will sign the application or if a

      A representative must have legal authority to make decisions for the
      Veteran. If you choose this option, we’ll ask you to upload a document
      that proves you have this authority.

      We can only accept a document that proves you have legal authority to make
      decisions for the Veteran (such as a valid Power of Attorney, legal
      guardianship order, or other legal document). We can’t accept a marriage
      certificate, driver’s license, or release of information form. Uploading a
      document that we can’t accept may delay the application process.
