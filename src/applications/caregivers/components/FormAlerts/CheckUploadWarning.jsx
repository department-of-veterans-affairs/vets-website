          It’s easy to upload the wrong file by mistake. We want to make sure
          that we will review the right document (such as a valid Power of
          Attorney, legal guardianship order, or other legal document). This
          will help speed up your application process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check the file name. If it’s not the right file, you can delete it and
          upload another one before you continue.
        </p>
