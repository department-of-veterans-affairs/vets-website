            A Caregiver Support Coordinator is a clinical professional who
            connects Veteran caregivers with VA and community resources that
            offer supportive programs and services. Caregiver Support
            Coordinators are located at every VA medical center and specialize
            in caregiving issues.

            Caregivers at any one time.
