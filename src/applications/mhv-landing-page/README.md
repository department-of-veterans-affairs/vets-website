# mhv-landing-page

## App

This app serves as the landing page for My HealtheVet (MHV) on VA.gov, providing quick access for veterans to access their health-related tools and information.

## Quick start to get running locally

Before you get started check [this page](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/setting-up-your-local-frontend-environment) first to make sure you are setup to use the correct version of Node and Yarn.

- clone vets-website repo `git clone git@github.com:department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website.git`
- run `yarn install`
- turn on local mocks `yarn mock-api --responses src/applications/mhv-landing-page/mocks/api/index.js`
- start app `yarn watch --env entry=mhv-landing-page`
- Run this in your browser console to simulate being logged in `localStorage.setItem('hasSession', true);`
- visit the app: `http://localhost:3001/my-health`
