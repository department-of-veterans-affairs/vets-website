Employment required extensive accommodations including specialized protective equipment, modified assignment protocols, and flexible medical leave. Final contract termination resulted from accumulation of combat injuries rendering field operations no longer viable. Veteran remains active in guild advisory capacity and reserve training program despite physical limitations."
