              priority groups. This system helps to make sure that Veterans who
              need immediate care can get signed up quickly. We assign Veterans
              with service-connected disabilities the highest priority. We
              assign the lowest priority to Veterans who earn a higher income
              and who don’t have any service-connected disabilities.{' '}
