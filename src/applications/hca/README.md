### How to run locally

Follow the standard directions to run the app. Vets API needs to be running in order to run the app locally.

### What API(s) does this use?

### Feature toggles

- We have a feature toggle to enable an override of enrollment status, `hca_enrollment_status_override_enabled`, to allow multiple submissions with same user.
- We have a feature toggle to enable DataDog's browser monitoring for the application, `hca_browser_monitoring_enabled`.

### How to test new features?

Each feature should have unit tests and e2e tests. We can use the Review Instances to review before merging a PR.
