            (Optional): Apply to the Physical Disability Board of Review (PDBR)
          </h4>
          <p>
            If you believe your disability rating for TBI, PTSD, or mental
            health conditions is too low, consider applying to the Physical
            Disability Board of Review (PDBR). The DoD created the PDBR
            specifically to review appeals about low disability ratings for
            Veterans discharged between 2001 and 2009. Some Veterans discharged
            during this period of time received lower disability ratings than
            they deserved, especially if they suffered from TBI, PTSD, or other
            mental health conditions. If you were discharged during this period
            of time and previously received a disability rating of 20% or lower,
            you’re eligible to apply to the PDBR for review. The PDBR does not
            issue discharge upgrades and cannot review conditions not listed in
            your military record before your separation. But, if the PDBR finds
            that your disability rating was unjustly low, it may help you make
            your case to upgrade your discharge.{' '}

            you can still apply for an upgrade. The important part of your
            application is where you explain the impact of the incident on your
