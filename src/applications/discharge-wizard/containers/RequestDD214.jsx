                    Pay special attention to item 6, which asks for the reason
                    for your change. Be clear that you want a DD214 for your
                    period of honorable service, and include the dates of that
                    period.

                    Item 8 asks for your date of “discovery” of the injustice.
                    In this case, it’s the day you “discovered” you were missing
                    an extra DD214 that you deserved. If this date isn’t in the
                    last 3 years, you’ll need to argue that the Board should
                    hear your case anyway. This isn’t a strict date, so don’t
                    let the 3-year rule keep you from applying if you have a
                    strong case. You may note your recent discovery of new
                    evidence about your situation, such as the ability to apply
                    for a discharge upgrade.

                    Item 10 asks if you’re willing to appear in person before
                    the Board in Washington, DC. The Board rarely asks Veterans
                    to appear in person, but saying you’re willing to do so may
                    help show how serious you are about your case.
