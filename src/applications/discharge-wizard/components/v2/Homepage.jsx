            Answer a series of questions to get customized step-by-step
            instructions on how to apply for a discharge upgrade or correction.
            If your application goes through and your discharge is upgraded,
            you’ll be eligible for the VA benefits you earned during your period
            of service.

          All branches of the military consider you to have a strong case for a
          discharge upgrade if you can show your discharge was connected to any
          of these categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mental health conditions, including posttraumatic stress disorder
            (PTSD)
          </li>
          <li>Traumatic brain injury (TBI)</li>
          <li>
            Sexual assault or harassment during military service (at VA, we
            refer to this as military sexual trauma or MST)
          </li>
          <li>
            Sexual orientation (including under the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell
            policy)
          </li>

            <p>
              Even with a less than honorable discharge, you may be able to
              access some VA benefits through the Character of Discharge review
              process. When you apply for VA benefits, we’ll review your record
              to determine if your service was “honorable for VA purposes.” This
              review can take up to a year. Please provide us with documents
              supporting your case, similar to the evidence you’d send with an
              application to upgrade your discharge.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may want to consider finding someone to advocate on your
              behalf, depending on the complexity of your case. A lawyer or
              Veterans Service Organization (VSO) can collect and submit
              supporting documents for you.{' '}

              <strong>Note:</strong> You can ask for a VA Character of Discharge
              review while at the same time applying for a discharge upgrade
              from the Department of Defense (DoD) or the Coast Guard.

              If you need mental health services related to PTSD or other mental
              health problems linked to your service (including conditions
              related to an experience of military sexual trauma), you may
              qualify for VA health benefits right away, even without a VA
              Character of Discharge review or a discharge upgrade.

          <va-accordion-item header="What if I already applied for an upgrade or correction and was denied?">
            <p>
              If your previous upgrade application was denied, you can apply
              again, but you may have to follow a different process. Select the{' '}
              <strong>Get Started</strong> link above. When you’re asked if
              you’ve applied before, select <strong>Yes</strong>. After you’ve
              answered all the questions, you’ll see application instructions
              specific to your situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Applying again is most likely to be successful if your application
              is significantly different from when you last applied. For
              example, you may have additional evidence that wasn’t available to
              you when you last applied, or the Department of Defense (DoD) may
              have issued new rules regarding discharges. DoD rules changed for
              discharges related to PTSD, TBI, and mental health in 2014,
              military sexual harassment and assault in 2017, and sexual
              orientation in 2011.

          <va-accordion-item header="What if I have discharges for more than one period of service?">
            <p>
              If the Department of Defense (DoD) or the Coast Guard determined
              you served honorably in one period of service, you may use that
              honorable characterization to establish eligibility for VA
              benefits, even if you later received a less than honorable
              discharge. You earned your benefits during the period in which you
              served honorably. Make sure you specifically mention your period
              of honorable service when applying for VA benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> The only exception is for service-connected
              disability compensation. You’re only eligible to earn disability
              compensation for disabilities you suffered during a period of
              honorable service. You can’t use an honorable discharge from one
              period of service to establish eligibility for a service-connected
              disability from a different period of service.
            </p>
          </va-accordion-item>
          <va-accordion-item header="What if I served honorably, but didn’t receive discharge paperwork?">
            <p>
              You’re eligible for VA benefits at the end of a period of
              honorable service, even if you didn’t receive a discharge in the
              form of a DD214. If you completed your original contract period
              without any disciplinary problems, you can use this period of
              service to establish your eligibility, even if you re-enlisted or
              extended your service and did not receive an “honorable” DD214 at
              the end of your second period of service. If you completed a
              period of honorable service that’s not reflected on a DD214, make
              sure you specifically mention this period of service when you
              apply for VA benefits. We may do a Character of Discharge review
              to confirm your eligibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also apply to the Department of Defense (DoD) or the Coast
              Guard for a second DD214 only for that honorable period of
              service. Select the <strong>Get Started</strong> link above and
              answer the questions based on your most recent discharge. When
              you’re asked if you completed a period of service in which your
              character of service was honorable or general under honorable
              conditions, select: “Yes, I completed a prior period of service,
              but I did not receive discharge paperwork from that period.”

          <va-accordion-item header="What if I have a DD215 showing an upgraded discharge, but my DD214 still isn’t correct?">
            <p>
              When the Department of Defense (DoD) or the Coast Guard upgrades a
              Veteran’s discharge, it usually issues a DD215 showing corrections
              to the DD214. The DoD or the Coast Guard attaches the DD215 to the
              old DD214—which still shows the outdated discharge and related
              information. While the discharge on the DD215 is the correct
              discharge, a Veteran may still want a new DD214 that shows no
              record of their earlier characterization of discharge.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a DD215 and want an updated DD214, select the{' '}
              <strong>Get Started</strong> link above. On the next page, select:
              “I received a discharge upgrade or correction, but my upgrade came
              in the form of a DD215, and I want an updated DD214.” After you’ve
              answered all the questions, you’ll see instructions for how to
              request a new DD214.
