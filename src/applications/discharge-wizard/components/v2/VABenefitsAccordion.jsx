      <p>
        Even with a less than honorable discharge, you may be able to access
        some VA benefits through the Character of Discharge review process. When
        you apply for VA benefits, we’ll review your record to determine if your
        service was “honorable for VA purposes.” This review can take up to a
        year. Provide us with documents supporting your case, similar to the
        evidence you’d send with an application to upgrade your discharge.
      </p>
      <p>
        An accredited attorney, claims agent, or Veterans Service Organization
        (VSO) representative can help you gather your evidence and submit your
        application. {vsoLink}.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> You can ask for a VA Character of Discharge
        review while at the same time applying for a discharge upgrade from the
        Department of Defense (DOD) or the Coast Guard.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you experienced sexual assault or harassment while in the military,
        or need mental health services related to PTSD or other mental health
        conditions linked to your service, you may qualify immediately for VA
        health benefits, even without a VA Character of Discharge review or a
        discharge upgrade.
