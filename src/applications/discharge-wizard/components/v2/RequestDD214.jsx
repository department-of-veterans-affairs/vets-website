            To receive a second DD214 reflecting <strong>only</strong> your

                Pay special attention to item 14, which asks for the reason for
                your change. Be clear that you want a DD214 for your period of
                honorable service, and include the dates of that period.

                Item 8 asks for your date of “discovery” of the injustice. In
                this case, it’s the day you “discovered” you were missing an
                extra DD214 that you deserved. If this date isn’t in the last 3
                years, you’ll need to argue that the Board should hear your case
                anyway. This isn’t a strict date, so don’t let the 3-year rule
                keep you from applying if you have a strong case. You may note
                your recent discovery of new evidence about your situation, such
                as the ability to apply for a discharge upgrade.

                Item 10 asks if you’re willing to appear in person before the
                Board in Washington, DC. The Board rarely asks Veterans to
                appear in person, but saying you’re willing to do so may help
                show how serious you are about your case.
