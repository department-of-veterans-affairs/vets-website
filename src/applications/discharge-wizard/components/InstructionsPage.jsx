                                  Even with a less than honorable discharge, you
                                  may be able to access some VA benefits through
                                  the Character of Discharge review process.
                                  When you apply for VA benefits, we’ll review
                                  your record to determine if your service was
                                  “honorable for VA purposes.” This review can
                                  take up to a year. Please provide us with
                                  documents supporting your case, similar to the
                                  evidence you’d send with an application to
                                  upgrade your discharge.

                                  received a less than honorable discharge. You
                                  earned your benefits during the period in
                                  which you served honorably. Make sure you
                                  specifically mention your period of honorable
                                  service when applying for VA benefits.

                                  period of service to establish eligibility for

                                  You’re eligible for VA benefits at the end of
                                  a period of honorable service, even if you
                                  didn’t receive a discharge in the form of a
                                  DD214. If you completed your original contract
                                  period without any disciplinary problems, you
                                  can use this period of service to establish
                                  your eligibility, even if you re-enlisted or
                                  extended your service and did not receive an
                                  “honorable” DD214 at the end of your second
                                  period of service. If you completed a period
                                  of honorable service that’s not reflected on a
                                  DD214, make sure you specifically mention this
                                  period of service when you apply for VA
                                  benefits. We may do a Character of Discharge
                                  review to confirm your eligibility.

                                  When the Department of Defense (DoD) or the
                                  Coast Guard upgrades a Veteran’s discharge, it
                                  usually issues a DD215 showing corrections to
                                  the DD214. The DoD or the Coast Guard attaches
                                  the DD215 to the old DD214—which still shows
                                  the outdated discharge and related
                                  information. While the discharge on the DD215
                                  is the correct discharge, a Veteran may still
                                  want a new DD214 that shows no record of their
                                  earlier characterization of discharge.
