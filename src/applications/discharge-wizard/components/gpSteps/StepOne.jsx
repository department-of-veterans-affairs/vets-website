          reconsideration if you have new evidence to present that wasn’t
          available when you applied last time. Make sure you’re clear about
          exactly what that new evidence is. Additionally, changes in DoD
          policy, like the new consideration guidelines for PTSD, TBI, and
          sexual assault or harassment, can qualify you for reconsideration.

          you didn’t file charges or report the incident, you can still apply
          for an upgrade. The important part of your application is where you
          explain the impact of the incident on your service. For example,
          detail how the incident caused a decrease in your productivity, or was
          the reason for PTSD.

          you’re asking the Board to address. If it’s been more than 3 years
          since you found this error or injustice, you’ll need to include a
          reason why the Board should consider your application. Examples of
          good reasons include new evidence you’ve found to support your claim,
          or recent changes in policy (like liberal consideration for PTSD, TBI,
          or military sexual assault or harassment). These kinds of reasons will
          make it more likely for the Board to decide in your favor. The 3-year
          time limit isn’t a strict rule, so don’t let it keep you from applying
          if you think you have a strong case.

            recommend you begin with this type of review. Also, if you’re denied
            in a Documentary Review, you can then appeal through a Personal
            Appearance Review. But you can’t request Documentary Review after a
            Personal Appearance Review.

                Although many Veterans are successful on their own, you may want
                to consider finding someone to advocate for you in this process.
                Try a Veterans Service Organization (VSO), search online for a
                lawyer who may provide services for low or no cost, or ask other
                Veterans for recommendations.{' '}
