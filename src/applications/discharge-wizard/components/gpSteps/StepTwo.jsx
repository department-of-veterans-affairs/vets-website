            the letter is more important than who it comes from, as long as the

            should state how they learned about the facts or opinions they’re
            writing about. The letters may include statements about your
            achievements in the military, positive relationships you formed in
            the military, why your discharge may be unjust or incorrect, and
            your good deeds during that time.

            issues related to drugs, alcohol, or bad behavior. This can be in
            the form of a letter from an employer or community leader, evidence
            of successful drug treatment, or copies of certificates and degrees.
            The DoD will soon release more specific information about
            achievements since service, but, for now, add any achievements you
            would like to call out.
