            re-enlist. This is a relatively straightforward application.

                Because you served honorably in one period of service, you can
                apply for VA benefits using that honorable characterization. You
                earned your benefits during the period in which you served
                honorably. The only exception is for service-connected
                disability compensation. If your disability began during your
                less than honorable period of service, you won’t be eligible to
                earn disability compensation unless you get that discharge
                upgraded. The instructions below this box tell you how to apply
                for an upgrade or correction to your final, less than honorable
                period of service.
