   > User `vets.gov.user+211@gmail.com` has a participant id
   > User `vets.gov.user+275@gmail.com` does not have a participant id

3. Run `vets-api`
4. Select ID.me from the drop down list and click the ‘Sign in with mocked authentication’ button.
5. Select a profile from the drop down (EX: `vets.gov.user+228@gmail.com`) and click the ‘Continue signing in’ button.
