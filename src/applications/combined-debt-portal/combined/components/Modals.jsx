    <h3>Collection by offset</h3>
    <p>
      We must collect debts owed to the U.S. government under VA programs. When
      we need to, we collect debts by withholding current and future VA benefits
      and life insurance dividends. We may also refer the debt to the Department
      of the Treasury for offset of most other federal payments.
    </p>
    <p>We conduct periodic computer matching efforts for these reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To identify people who owe money to VA and who are federal employees,
        military members, or retirees
      </li>
      <li>
        To get the addresses of people who owe money to VA from their federal
        tax returns
      </li>
      <li>To alert government-backed mortgage lenders of outstanding debt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you owe money to the government, your federal pay and retirement
      benefits are subject to offset. We may also cancel any benefit checks not
      cashed within 1 year and apply the money to offset outstanding debts. We
      won’t reissue those checks.
    </p>

    <h3>Late charges</h3>
    <p>
      We’re required by law to assess late charges for health care copay debts
      that remain unpaid 30 days after the statement date. These charges can
      consist of interest and administrative fees. You can avoid these charges
      by making timely payments by the balance due date on the initial billing
      statement. If you have a repayment plan with us for a debt and we don’t
      receive an installment by the due date, we may charge you a monthly
      administrative cost or collection fee until you’ve paid the debt in full.
    </p>

    <h3>Right to dispute the existence or amount of a debt</h3>
    <p>
      If you believe you don’t owe a debt or that the amount is incorrect, you
      have the right to dispute it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To dispute a debt, you must explain in writing why you question the
      validity or amount of the debt. If your benefits are scheduled to offset,
      you must write us within 30 days of your first debt letter or copay bill
      to avoid that action.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we receive your dispute within 30 days, we’ll suspend the offset action
      until we confirm that the debt is valid and the amount is correct. If the
      delay required to resolve your dispute prevents us from collecting the
      full amount of the debt from your benefits, we don’t suspend collection
      action. If we determine that the debt and the amount are correct, you
      still have the right to appeal our decision to the Board of Veterans
      Appeals.
    </p>
    <p>You can get help with disputing a debt in either of these ways:</p>

          text="va.gov/contact-us/ask-va/"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        Calling the Debt Management Center at{' '}
        <va-telephone contact={CONTACTS.DMC} /> (
        <va-telephone contact={CONTACTS[711]} tty />
        ). For international callers, use{' '}
        <va-telephone contact={CONTACTS.DMC_OVERSEAS} international />. We’re
        here Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Right to request waiver of a debt</h3>
    <p>
      Under certain circumstances, we can grant a request to waive part or all
      of the debt. This means that you won’t have to pay the amount waived.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must submit your request to waive a debt online or in writing. Explain
      any responsibility you had in causing the debt or why you believe you
      aren’t responsible for the debt. If you feel that collection of the debt
      would be unfair or discriminatory to you or cause you undue hardship,
      explain this in your request.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prove your financial hardship, you must also complete the Financial
      Status Report form (VA Form 5655) and submit it with your waiver request
    </p>
    <p>
      You have 1 year from the date of your first debt letter or copay bill to
      submit a waiver request. A VA service representative at your nearest VA
      regional office can help you prepare your waiver request and supporting
      documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note: </strong>
      Waiver of an education benefit overpayment won’t restore the program
      entitlement you used by receiving the benefits that caused the debt. Only
      payment of the debt in full can restore entitlement.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>Effect of waiver request on withholding of benefits</h3>
    <p>
      If we notified you that we plan to withhold your VA benefits to offset a
      debt, we must receive your request for waiver within 30 days of the date
      of notice to prevent the withholding.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we don’t receive your request within 30 days, the scheduled offset will
      occur and will continue while we consider your waiver request. If we grant
      the waiver, we’ll pay you back any amount we withheld and applied to the
      waived debt.
    </p>

    <h3>Oral hearing on waiver request</h3>
    <p>
      You can request an oral hearing to present evidence or argue any point in
      connection with your waiver request. If you want a hearing, request it
      when you submit your request for waiver. This will allow us to schedule
      the hearing before we make a decision on your waiver request.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you request a hearing, we’ll notify you of the date, time, and place
      where we’ll hold the hearing. You can bring witnesses. We’ll enter all
      testimony into the record. We’ll also provide a dedicated hearing room and
      hearing officials, and we’ll prepare a written transcript of the
      proceeding. We can’t cover the cost of any other expense for the hearing.
    </p>

    <h3>Hardship determination: Health care copay debts</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to request a hardship determination to get an exemption
      from future outpatient and inpatient copays for the remaining calendar
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      To request a hardship determination, submit a Request for Hardship
      Determination (VA Form 10-10HS). Also include a letter explaining any
      financial hardship these charges will cause you.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your gross household income has decreased, you may also be eligible for
      enrollment in a higher priority group, which may qualify you for copay
      exemption. To update your financial information, submit a completed Health
      Benefits Update (VA Form 10-10 EZR).
