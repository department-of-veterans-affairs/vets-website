    <h4>Collection</h4>
    <p>
      The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is required to collect debts
      owed to the government. Action must be taken within sixty (60) days from
      the initial billing statement to pay your debt in full or establish a
      payment plan or your account may be referred for further collection
      action. You have the right to inspect and copy the records related to the
      debt. You also have the right to establish a payment plan. You have the
      right to submit a compromise offer. Collection action includes referring
      your delinquent balance to the Department of Treasury's Cross-Servicing
      Program and Treasury Offset Program, which will include offset of any
      federal and state payments to which you are entitled. This includes tax
      refunds, social security benefits and salary or retirement benefits. In
      addition, the Department of Treasury may refer your account to private
      collection agencies, which will result in additional fees and interest
      being added to your account. You may also be subject to garnishment of
      non- federal wages under Treasury's Administrative Wage Garnishment
      Program. Other collection actions include offset of any current or future
      VA benefits to which you may become entitled. We may also report your
      delinquent account to credit reporting agencies sixty (60) days from the
      date of the initial billing statement. Additional information can be found
      at:
      <a
        href="https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/cost/"
        className="vads-u-margin-left--0p5"
      >
        www.va.gov/healthbenefits/cost/.
      </a>
    </p>

    <h4>Pay your bill</h4>
    <p>
      Pay the debt in full by the balance due date on the initial billing
      statement to avoid late charges and collection action:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In Person: At your local Veteran Affairs Medical Centers Agent Cashier's
        Office
      </li>
      <li>
        By Phone: Contact VA at
        <va-telephone
          international
          contact="8888274817"
          className="vads-u-margin-x--0p5"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        By Mail: Make check or money order payable to "VA" and include account
        number and payment stub. Submit to: Department of Veterans Affairs, P.O.
        Box 3978, Portland, OR 97208-3978
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Late charges</h4>
    <p>
      The VA is required to assess late charges on balances which remain unpaid
      thirty (30) days after the statement date. These charges consist of
      interest and administrative fees at rates established each year. Interest
      will be charged from the date charges first appear on the statement. You
      can avoid these charges by making timely payments by the balance due date
      on the initial billing statement. A monthly administrative cost or
      collection fee will be added to your debt if, within thirty (30) days of
      the date of the statement on which charges first appear, full payment of
      the debt is not received or a repayment plan agreement is not approved. If
      an installment repayment plan is established and any installment is not
      received by the due date, the monthly administrative cost or collection
      fee will thereafter be charged until the debt is paid. Other collection
      costs may also be added to the debt if additional collection actions
      become necessary.
    </p>

    <h4>Waiver</h4>
    <p>
      You have the right to request a waiver of part or all of your debt. If the
      waiver is granted you will not be required to pay the amount waived. To do
      so, submit an explanation and a completed Financial Status Report (VA Form
      5655) found at:
      <a
        aria-label="Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655) - Opens in new window"

      >
        Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655)
      </a>
      . Your explanation should include why you are not responsible for the debt
      and any undue hardship the payment of the debt would cause you. You have
      the right to request a hearing in connection with your request for a
      waiver. To do so, submit a written request for hearing with your waiver
      request. VA will notify you of the date, time and place where the hearing
      will be held. Refer to the "Customer Service" and "Submitting Your
      Request" sections below for more information
    </p>

    <h4>Compromise offer</h4>
    <p>
      You have the right to request a compromise. A compromise means you may
      propose a lesser amount as full settlement of the debt. To request a
      compromise, submit your request in writing to VA, specifying the dollar
      amount you are proposing VA should accept as payment in full, and a
      completed Financial status Report (VA Form 5655) found at:

    <h4>Repayment plan</h4>

      full. To do so, submit a completed Agreement to Pay Indebtedness (VA Form
      1100) found at:

        className="vads-u-margin-left--0p5"

      more information.
    </p>

    <h4>Dispute the existence or amount of the debt </h4>
    <p>
      You have the right to dispute the existence or amount of the debt. To do
      so, submit a letter explaining why you question the validity or amount of
      the debt. To avoid late charges, you must submit a dispute by the balance
      due date on the initial billing statement. VA will not initiate collection
      if your dispute is received within sixty (60) days from the initial
      billing statement. If VA receives your notice later than sixty (60) days
      and collection has been initiated, it will continue while the dispute is
      being reviewed. If the dispute is resolved in your favor, all late charges
      will be removed from your account, and any amounts withheld from your VA
      benefits, federal payments, or wages will be refunded to you. Refer to the
      "Customer Service" and "Submitting Your Request" sections below for more
      information.
    </p>

    <h4>Hardship determination</h4>

      hardship these charges will cause you and a completed Request for Hardship

    <h4>Notice to customers making payment by check</h4>
    <p>
      When you provide a check as payment, you authorize VA to either use
      information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer
      from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When
      VA uses information from your check to make an electronic transfer, funds
      may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the day we process your
      payment, and you will not receive your check back from the financial
      institution. A Privacy Act Statement required by 5 U.S.C & 552a(e)(3)

      your check, and explaining the purposes and routine uses which will be

      method.
