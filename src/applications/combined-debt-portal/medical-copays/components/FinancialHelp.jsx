      How to get financial help for your copays

      If you’re struggling because of life situations like losing your job,
      having a sudden decrease in income, or having an increase in out-of-pocket
      family health care expenses, we can help.

        <p>You can request these debt relief options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Repayment plan.</strong> This would allow you to repay the
            debt in smaller monthly amounts over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compromise offer.</strong> This means you offer a lesser
            one-time lump sum amount as full payment of the debt. If we approve
            your request, you’ll have to pay the one-time amount within 30 days.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Waiver.</strong> This means you ask us to forgive (or
            “waive”) part or all of the debt. If we approve your request, you
            won’t have to pay the amount waived.
          </li>
        </ul>

          You may be eligible for a hardship determination, which would qualify
          you for a copay exemption. This means we’ll assign you to a higher
          priority group, and you won’t have to pay any VA copays for the rest
          of the calendar year.
