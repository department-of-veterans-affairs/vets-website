        How to dispute an overpayment
      </h2>

      <p>
        If you think your debt is an error, your first step should be to dispute
        the charges. The time limit to dispute a debt is <strong>1 year</strong>{' '}
        from the date you received your first debt letter. If you dispute the
        debt within <strong>30 days</strong>, you can avoid collection actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Youâ€™ll need to continue making payments on your debt while we review
        your dispute.{' '}
