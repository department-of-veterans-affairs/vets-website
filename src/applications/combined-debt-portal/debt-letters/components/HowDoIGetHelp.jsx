        <p>You can request these relief options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Repayment plan.</strong> This would allow you to repay the
            debt in smaller monthly amounts over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compromise offer.</strong> This means you offer a lesser
            one-time lump sum amount as full payment of the debt. If we approve
            your request, you’ll have to pay the one-time amount within 30 days.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Waiver.</strong> This means you ask us to forgive (or
            “waive”) part or all of the debt. If we approve your request, you
            won’t have to pay the amount waived.
          </li>
        </ul>
