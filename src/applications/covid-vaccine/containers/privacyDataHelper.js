      <strong>Privacy Act Notice:</strong> § 116 of Public Law 115-48 authorizes
      VA to implement a 5-year pilot program that proves eligible Veterans the
      opportunity to enroll in high technology programs of education that
      provide training and skills sought by employers in relevant high
      technology fields or industries. Accelerated Learning Programs targeted
      for VET TEC are generally less than 10 months in duration, offered by
      organizations which are not institutions of higher learning, and do not
      lead to a degree. They are designed to provide students the requisite
      training in demand by employers seeking to source IT talent. Also this
      form will be used to collect certain information from interested
      applicants to be used in VA reports to Congress that will help determine
      if the program should continue. While you do not have to respond, VA
      cannot process your claim for education assistance unless the information
      is furnished as required by Public Law 115-48. The responses you submit
      are considered confidential (38 U.S.C. 5701). Any information provided by
      applicants, recipients, and others may be subject to verification through
      computer matching programs with other agencies.
