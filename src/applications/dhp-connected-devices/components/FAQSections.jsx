          The VA Digital Health Pathway Fitbit Pilot (i.e., the Pilot) is an
          effort designed to evaluate how VA can provide you with an opportunity
          to share your patient-generated data (PGD) with your VA care team.
          This pilot is not meant to replace normal care activities between you
          and your VA care team. The estimated duration of this pilot is 6-12
          months, after which your ability to connect and share data through the
          Digital Health Pathway may be discontinued.

          By participating in the pilot, the data you choose to share with the
          VA may be accessed by your VA care team and discussed with you. At any
          time, you can choose to opt out of the pilot and disconnect your
          device in the Connected Devices section. If you choose to opt out of
          the pilot, any data will be retained for a minimum timeframe of 6-12
          months (duration of the pilot). At the end of the pilot, data will be
          retained for a minimum timeframe of 6 to 12 months.

          A connected device is any device that can connect to the internet so
          that it can communicate with other devices or computers. Examples of
          connected devices include smartphones, wearable fitness trackers (like
          a Fitbit), or a connected blood pressure cuff. Many connected devices
          let you share your data from the device with other people such as your
          care provider. If your VA care team asked you to connect your device,
          they will be able to access the data you choose to share.
