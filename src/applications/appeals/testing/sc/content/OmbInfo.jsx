        collected on this form to any source other than what has been authorized
        under the Privacy Act of 1974 or title 38, Code of Federal Regulations,
        section 1.576 for routine uses (i.e., civil or criminal law enforcement,
        congressional communications, epidemiological or research studies, the
        collection of money owed to the United States, litigation in which the
        United States is a party or has an interest, the administration of VA
        programs and delivery of VA benefits, verification of identity and
        status, and personnel administration) as identified in the following VA
        systems of records published in the Federal Register, 58/VA21/22/28,
        Compensation, Pension, Education and Veterans Readiness and Employment
        Records -VA; 55VA26 Loan Guaranty Home, Condominium and Manufactured
        Home Loan Applicant Records, Specially Adapted Housing Applicant
        Records, and Vendee Loan Applicant Records -VA; and 36VA29, Veterans and
        Armed Forces Personnel Programs of Government Life Insurance -VA. Your
        obligation to respond is required to obtain or retain benefits. VA uses
        your SSN to identify your claims file. Providing your SSN will help
        ensure that your records are properly associated with your claim file.
        Giving us your SSN account information is voluntary. Refusal to provide
        your SSN by itself will not result in the denial of benefits. VA will
        not deny an individual benefits for refusing to provide his or her SSN
        unless the disclosure of the SSN is required by a Federal Statute of law
        in effect prior to January 1, 1975, and still in effect. The requested
        information is considered relevant and necessary to determine maximum
        benefits under the law. The responses you submit are considered
        confidential (38 U.S.C. 5701). Information submitted is subject to
        verification through computer matching programs with other agencies.

        <strong>Respondent Burden:</strong> We need this information and your
        written authorization to obtain your treatment records to help us get
        the information required to process your claim. Title 38, United States
        Code, allows us to ask for this information. You can provide this by
        signing VA Form 21-4142. Federal law permits sources with information
        about you to release that information if you sign a single authorization
        to release all your information from all possible sources. We will make
        copies of it for each source. A few States, and some individual sources
        of information, require that the authorization specifically name the
        source that you authorize to release personal information. In those
        cases, we may ask you to sign one authorization for each source and we
        may contact you again if we need you to sign more authorizations. We
        estimate that you will need an average of 10 minutes to review the
