          You can submit this online form (VA Form 10182) to appeal a VA
          decision dated on or after February 19, 2019. The Board must receive
          your completed form <strong>within 1 year (365 days)</strong> from the
          date listed on your decision notice, unless one of these situations
          apply:

            <strong>If you have a contested claim</strong>
            <p>
              A contested claim is when 2 or more people are claiming the right
              to a benefit that only 1 person can claim. If our decision
              involves a contested claim, the Board must receive your completed
              form within 60 days from the date listed on your decision notice.

              <li>
