      <strong>Request a direct review</strong>
      <p>
        A Veterans Law Judge will review your appeal based on evidence already
        submitted. Because the Board has all your evidence, choosing this option
        will often result in a faster decision.
      </p>
    </>

  evidence_submission: (
    <>
      <strong>Submit more evidence</strong>
      <p>
        You can submit additional evidence within 90 days after submitting your
        Board appeal. Choose this option if you want to turn in additional
        evidence but donâ€™t want to wait for a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge.
        Choosing this option will extend the time it takes for the Board to
        decide your appeal.

  hearing: (

      <strong>Request a hearing</strong>
      <p>
        You can request a Board hearing with a Veterans Law Judge and submit
        additional evidence within 90 days after your hearing. Keep in mind that
        this option has the longest wait time for a decision because there are
        currently tens of thousands of pending hearing requests.
