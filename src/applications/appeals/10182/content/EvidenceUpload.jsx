    <p>
      You can upload your document in a {fileTypes()} file format. Youâ€™ll first
      need to scan a copy of your document onto your computer or mobile phone.
      You can then upload the document from there.
    </p>
    <p>Guidelines for uploading a file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>File types you can upload: {fileTypes()}</li>
      <li>{`Maximum file size: ${MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB}MB`}</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <em>
        A 1MB file equals about 500 pages of text. A photo is usually about 6MB.
        Large files can take longer to upload with a slow Internet connection.
