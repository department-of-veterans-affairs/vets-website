        A Veterans Law Judge will review your appeal based on evidence already
        submitted. Because the Board has all your evidence, choosing this option
        will often result in a faster decision. Based on current estimates, it
        takes the Board about <strong>1 year</strong> to make a decision for
        this type of appeal.

        You can request a Board hearing with a Veterans Law Judge and submit
        additional evidence within 90 days after your hearing. Please keep in
        mind that this option has the longest wait time for a decision because
        of the high number of pending hearing requests. Based on current
        estimates, it takes the Board <strong>more than 2 years</strong> to make
        a decision for this type of appeal.
