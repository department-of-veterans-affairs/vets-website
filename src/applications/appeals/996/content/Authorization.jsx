      <p>
        If you’re requesting a Higher-Level Review on a decision we made before
        February 19, 2019, we’ll need to go through our modernized decision
        review process.
      </p>
      <p>
        By submitting this form, you agree to move your issue from the old
        legacy appeals process to the modernized decision review process. You
        won’t be able to move your issue back to the legacy appeals process.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll likely make a faster decision on your issue in our modernized
        decision review process.

        your SOC or SSOC.

        You’re withdrawing the eligible legacy appeal issues you’ve selected in
        this request in their entirety, and any associated hearing requests, and
        opting for the issues to be decided in the modernized decision review
        process.
