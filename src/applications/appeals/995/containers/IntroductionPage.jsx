            Your obligation to respond is required to obtain or retain benefits.
            VA uses your SSN to identify your claims file. Providing your SSN
            will help ensure that your records are properly associated with your
            claim file. Giving us your SSN account information is voluntary.
            Refusal to provide your SSN by itself will not result in the denial
            of benefits. VA will not deny an individual benefits for refusing to
            provide his or her SSN unless the disclosure of the SSN is required
            by a Federal Statute of law in effect prior to January 1, 1975, and
            still in effect. The requested information is considered relevant
            and necessary to determine maximum benefits under the law. The
            responses you submit are considered confidential (38 U.S.C. 5701).
            Information submitted is subject to verification through computer
            matching programs with other agencies.
