        <p>
          You should not complete this form unless you want the VA to obtain
          private treatment records on your behalf. If you have already provided
          these records or intend to obtain them yourself, there is no need to
          fill out this form. Doing so will lengthen your claim processing time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In accordance with 38 C.F.R. ยง3.159(c), "VA will not pay any fees
          charged by a custodian to provide records requested."
        </p>
        <p>
          I hereby authorize the sources listed in Section IV, to release any
          information that may have been obtained in connection with a physical,
          psychological or psychiatric examination or treatment, with the
          understanding that VA will use this information in determining my
          eligibility to veterans benefits I have claimed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that the source being asked to provide the Veterans
          Benefits Administration with records under this authorization may not
          require me to execute this authorization before it provides me with
          treatment, payment for health care, enrollment in a health plan, or
          eligibility for benefits provided by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that once my source sends this information to VA under
          this authorization, the information will no longer be protected by the
          HIPAA Privacy Rule, but will be protected by the Federal Privacy Act,
          5 USC 552a, and VA may disclose this information as authorized by law.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also understand that I may revoke this authorization in writing, at
          any time except to the extent a source of information has already
          relied on it to take an action. To revoke, I must send a written
          statement to the VA Regional Office handling my claim or the Board of
          Veterans' Appeals (if my claim is related to an appeal) and also send
          a copy directly to any of my sources that I no longer wish to disclose
          information about me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that VA may use information disclosed prior to revocation
          to decide my claim.
