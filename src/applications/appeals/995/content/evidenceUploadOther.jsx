      Lay statements or other. A lay statement is a written statement from
      family, friends, or coworkers to help support your claim. Lay statements
      are also called “buddy statements.” In most cases, you’ll only need your
      medical records to support your disability claim. But some claims—such as
      those for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder or military sexual trauma—could
      benefit from a lay or buddy statement.
