      When you submit an Intent to File, you’re telling us that you plan to file
      a claim. This sets a potential start date (called an effective date) for
      when you could start getting benefits. It gives you time to prepare your
      claim and gather supporting documents. And it means that your start date
      for benefits may be earlier than the date you file your claim.

      <strong>What an intent to file means: </strong>
      <p className="vads-u-font-size--base">
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you’re filing a Supplemental Claim to request a review of a claim
            we decided longer than 1 year ago, an intent to file sets a
            potential start date (or effective date) for your benefits. You then
            have up to 1 year to complete and file your Supplemental Claim. And
            you may be able to get payments for the time between when you
            submitted your intent to file and when we approved your claim.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you’re submitting a Supplemental Claim to request a review of a
            claim we decided within the past year, an intent to file gives you 1
            year to complete and file your Supplemental Claim. But we’ll use the
            original date you filed the claim under review as the potential
            start date for your benefits.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br />
      <strong>What you can do next:</strong>
      <p className="vads-u-font-size--base">
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can continue and submit your claim online today—or when you’re
            ready. If we don’t have an intent to file on record for this claim
            that’s within the past year, we’ll use the date you submit your
            claim as a potential start date for your benefits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Or you can call us to confirm if you have an intent to file for this
            claim and what your next step should be. Call us at{' '}
