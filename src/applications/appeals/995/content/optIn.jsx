      <h3>The new decision review process</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re filing a Supplemental Claim in response to a Statement of the
        Case (SOC) or a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) in the old
        appeals process (for a VA decision you received before February 19,
        2019), you’re opting into the new decision review process. You must opt
        in within 60 days from the date you received your SOC or SSOC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you opt in, we’ll move your claim from the old appeals process to
        the new decision review process. You won’t be able to return to the old
        appeals process for the issues you have selected. You’re likely to get a
        faster decision on your claim when you switch to the new process.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to continue your claim in the old appeals process, don’t
        submit a Supplemental Claim. Check your decision notice for more details
        about the appeals process.
      </p>
