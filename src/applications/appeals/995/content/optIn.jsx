    <h3>Opt-in to the new decision review process</h3>
    <p>
      If you’re filing a Supplemental Claim for an issue in an initial claim
      that we decided before February 19, 2019, you’ll need to opt in to the new
      decision review process. When you do this, we’ll move your issue from the
      old appeals process to the new decision review process. You’re likely to
      get a faster decision on your claim when you switch to the new process.
    </p>

    I understand that I'm opting in to the new decision review process. This
    means any isues I want reviewed from the old appeals process will move into
    the new decision review process.
