    <h3>Review and acknowledge this notice of evidence needed.</h3>
    <p>
      You’ll need to submit new evidence we haven’t reviewed before that’s
      related to the issue you’re claiming.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        We’ll look for evidence that shows both of these are true:
      </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You have a current physical or mental disability (damage to your body or
        mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks,
        including meaningful work), <strong>and</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        An event, injury, or illness that happened while you were serving in the
        military caused this disability
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You’ll need to submit or give us permission to gather medical evidence
      from a VA medical center, other federal facility, or your private health
      care provider.
