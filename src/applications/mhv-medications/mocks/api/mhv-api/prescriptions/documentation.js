  "<body><Page><h1>Repaglinide</h1><h3>Brand Name(s): Prandin®, Prandimet® (as a combination product containing Metformin, Repaglinide)</h3><h2>WHY is this medicine prescribed?</h2><p>Repaglinide is used to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Repaglinide helps your body regulate the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. It decreases the amount of glucose by stimulating the pancreas to release insulin.</p><p>Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems.Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.</p><p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p><h2>HOW should this medicine be used?</h2><p>Repaglinide comes as a tablet to take by mouth.

See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website (http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</p><p>It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org</p><h2>What should I do in case of OVERDOSE?</h2><p>In case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222.

Follow these instructions carefully.</p><p>You should always wear a diabetic identification bracelet to be sure you get proper treatment in an emergency.</p><p>Do not let anyone else take your medication.
