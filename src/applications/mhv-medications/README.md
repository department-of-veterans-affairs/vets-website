# Front-End Prescription Object Guide

## Overview

The 'Prescription' object holds data about prescriptions as they move from the API to vets-api and then to vets-website. This guide explains each field's name, purpose, usage context, examples, and how field names change across different layers. It focuses on how the data appears on the front end after being received, without covering the back end or API details (like changes made by a serializer).

## Purpose
This document helps front-end developers know which fields to use for new features and which ones are already in use. It also helps improve communication between developers working on different parts of the stack by clarifying the names used for the same fields.
