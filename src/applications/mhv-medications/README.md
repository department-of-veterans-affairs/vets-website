# MHV Medications

## Quick start to get running locally

Before you get started check [this page](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/setting-up-your-local-frontend-environment) first to make sure you are setup to use the correct version of Node and Yarn.

- clone vets-website repo `git clone git@github.com:department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website.git`
- run `yarn install`
- start app `yarn --cwd $( git rev-parse --show-toplevel ) watch --env entry=medications`
- turn on local mocks `yarn --cwd $( git rev-parse --show-toplevel ) mock-api --responses src/applications/mhv-medications/mocks/api/index.js`
- Run this in your browser console to simulate being logged in `localStorage.setItem('hasSession', true);`
- visit the app: `http://localhost:3001/my-health/medications`

## Running tests

Unit tests for can be run using this command: `yarn test:unit --app-folder mhv-medications`. To get detailed errors, run this command with `--log-level=error`. To get coverage reports run this command `yarn test:unit --app-folder mhv-medications --coverage --coverage-html`. View the report at `/coverage/index.html`

Cypress tests can be run with the GUI using this command: `yarn cy:open`. From there you can filter by `mhv-medications` to run just medications end to end tests.

Run Cypress from command line:

- Run all `yarn cy:run --spec "src/applications/mhv-medications/**/**/*"`
- Specify browser `-b electron`

## Front End Prescription Object Guide

### Overview

When working on the MHV Medications team, understanding the prescription object is important for developing new features or working with existing ones. The 'Prescription' object holds data about prescriptions as they move from the MHV API to vets-api and then to vets-website. This document explains each field's name, purpose, usage context, and examples. It focuses on how the data appears on the front end after being received, without covering the vets-api or MHV API details (like changes made by a serializer).

### Purpose

This document was created to help front-end developers understand the prescription object and identify which fields to use for new features and which ones are currently in use. It also helps improve communication between developers working on different parts of the stack by clarifying the names used for the same fields.
