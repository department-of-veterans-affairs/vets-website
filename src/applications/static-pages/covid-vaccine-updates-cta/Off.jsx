          We're creating an easy way for you to sign up to stay informed about
          our COVID-19 vaccine plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you sign up, weâ€™ll also ask about your interest in getting a
          vaccine when one is available to you. By sharing your interest, you
          can help us better prepare as we work to offer vaccines to more
          Veterans.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> You don't need to sign up to get a vaccine.
