            We're creating an easy way for you to sign up to stay informed about
            our COVID-19 vaccine plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you sign up, weâ€™ll also ask about your interest in getting a
            vaccine when one is available to you. By sharing your interest, you
            can help us better prepare as we work to offer vaccines to more
            Veterans.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> You don't need to sign up to get a vaccine.
