              You and the Veteran will need to apply together and participate in
              an application process&nbsp;to determine if you’re eligible for
              the program.
            </p>

            <p>
              To apply, fill out a joint Application for the Program of
              Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (VA Form 10-10CG).
              You’ll need information such as contact information for you and
              the Veteran as well as the name of the VA medical center where the
              Veteran will be receiving care. And you’ll both need to sign and
              date the form.

              <br />
              <strong>Note</strong>: Each time the Veteran wants to add a new
              family caregiver, the Veteran and the new caregiver will need to
              submit a new application.&nbsp;Remember, there can only be 1
              Primary and up to 2 Secondary Family Caregivers designated at any
              one time.
