      <h3>What are My HealtheVet and My VA Health, and which will I use?</h3>
      <p>
        My HealtheVet and My VA Health are both VA health management portals
        designed to help you manage your care. My VA Health is our new portal
        that providers at select facilities have started to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each portal offers a tool to help you manage your medical records. The
        portal you’ll use will depend on where you receive care. If you receive
        care at more than one VA facility, you may need to use both portals.

          <p>
            The Veterans Health Information Exchange (VHIE) program lets us
            securely share your health information with participating community
            care providers in our network. VHIE also lets us share your
            information with the Department of Defense.
          </p>
          <p>
            VHIE gives your health care providers a more complete understanding
            of your health record. This more complete understanding can help
            your providers make more informed treatment decisions. We share your
            health information with participating community providers only when
            they’re treating you.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don’t want us to share your information through VHIE, you can
            opt out at any time.
