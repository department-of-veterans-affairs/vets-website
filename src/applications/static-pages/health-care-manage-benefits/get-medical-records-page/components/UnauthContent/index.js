        <p>
          The Veterans Health Information Exchange (VHIE) program lets us
          securely share your health information with participating community
          care providers in our network. VHIE also lets us share your
          information with the Department of Defense.
        </p>
        <p>
          VHIE gives your health care providers a more complete understanding of
          your health record. This more complete understanding can help your
          providers make more informed treatment decisions. We share your health
          information with participating community providers only when they’re
          treating you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don’t want us to share your information through VHIE, you can
          opt out at any time.
