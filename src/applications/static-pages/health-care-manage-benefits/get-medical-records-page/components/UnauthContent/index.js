      </li>
      <li>
        Download a Health Summary that includes specific information from your

    <h2 id="vhie">The Veterans Health Information Exchange</h2>
    <p>
      The Veterans Health Information Exchange (VHIE) program lets us
      automatically and securely share your health information with
      participating community care providers as well as the Department of
      Defense.
    </p>
    <h3>What's VHIE, and how can it help me manage my health?</h3>
    <p>
      VHIE gives your health care providers a more complete view of your health
      record to help them make more informed treatment decisions. Through VHIE,
      community providers who are a part of your care team can safely and
      securely receive your VA health information electronically.
    </p>

    <p>
      VHIE helps improve continuity of your care, reduce test duplication, and
      avoid clinical error. That's because you can see all your health care
      providers from different practices or networks in one place. Our secure
      system also eliminates the need to send paper medical records by mail, and
      to carry your records to appointments with community providers.
    </p>

    <p>
      We share your health information only with participating community
      providers via VHIE when they're treating you. Visit the{' '}
      <a href="/VHIE/">VHIE page</a> to learn more about how the program helps
      your providers better understand your health history and develop safer,
      more effective treatment plans.
    </p>
    <h4>VHIE sharing options</h4>
    <p>
      If you don't want your community providers to receive your information via
      VHIE, you may opt out of electronic sharing at any time. And if you
      previously opted out but want to resume secure, seamless sharing, you may
      opt back in. Visit the{' '}
      <a href="/VHIE/VHIE_Sharing_Options.asp">VHIE Sharing Options page</a> to
      learn more.
    </p>
    <h3>How do I opt out?</h3>
    <p>
      If you would prefer to opt out of sharing your health information
      electronically, you can do so at any time. You must complete and submit{' '}
      <a href="/vaforms/medical/pdf/10-10164-fill.pdf">
        VA Form 10-10164 (PDF)
      </a>{' '}
      to your facility’s Release of Information Office (ROI). You may also opt
      out via{' '}
      <a
        href="https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/home"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
      >
        My HealtheVet
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> If you haven't already done so, you'll need to
      upgrade your My HealtheVet account to Premium status to opt out. Visit{' '}
      <a
        href="https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/home"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
      >
        My HealtheVet
      </a>{' '}
      to learn more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choosing to opt out will not affect your access to care from community
      providers. However, if you opt out, your community providers may not
      receive your medical records before you receive treatment. This may put
      you at risk. Also, if you visit any emergency room, your information may
      still be shared via VHIE so that you can receive the care you need.
    </p>
    <h3>If I opt out, how can I opt back in?</h3>
    <p>
      If you previously opted out, but want to resume secure, seamless sharing,
      you may do so at any time. Simply complete{' '}
      <a href="/vaforms/medical/pdf/10-10163-fill.pdf">
        VA Form 10-10163 (PDF)
      </a>{' '}
      and return it to your VA facility's ROI office, or submit it online though{' '}
      <a
        href="https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/home"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
      >
        My HealtheVet
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <h3>Can I check my sharing preference status?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. Please contact your VA facility's ROI office. If you've already
      submitted your form to opt out, or to opt back in, to the electronic
      sharing program, your request may be in process.
