    <h2>Can I use this tool to refill and track all my VA prescriptions?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>
        You can refill and track most of your VA prescriptions, including:
      </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>VA medicines that you’ve refilled or renewed</li>
      <li>Wound care supplies</li>
      <li>Diabetic supplies</li>
      <li>
        Other products and supplies sent through the VA Mail Order Pharmacy
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your VA health care team may decide not to ship medicines that you don’t
      need right away, medicines that aren’t commonly prescribed, or those that
      require you to be closely monitored. In these cases, you’ll need to pick
      up your prescription from the VA health facility where you get care.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can’t refill some medicines, like certain pain medications and
      narcotics. You’ll need to get a new prescription from your VA provider
      each time you need more of these medicines.
    </p>

    <h2>Where will VA send my prescriptions?</h2>
    <p>
      Our mail order pharmacy will send your prescriptions to the address we
      have on file for you. We ship to all addresses in the United States and
      its territories. We don’t ship prescriptions to foreign countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Important note:</strong> Changing your address within My
      HealtheVet doesn’t change your address for prescription shipments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        To change your address on file with VA for prescription shipments:
      </strong>

        <a href="/change-address/">
          change your address in your VA.gov profile
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Or contact the VA health facility where you get care to have them update
        your address on file.
        <br />
        <a href="/find-locations/">Find your VA health facility</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When will I get my prescriptions, and when should I reorder?</h2>
    <p>
      Prescriptions usually arrive within 3 to 5 days. You can find specific
      information about your order on the website of the delivery service shown
      in your Rx Tracker.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make sure you have your medicine in time, please request your refill at
      least 10 days before you need more medicine.
    </p>
