                My HealtheVet and My Health VA are both VA health management
                portals designed to help you manage your care. My VA Health is
                our new portal that providers at select facilities have started
                to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                The portal you’ll use to view your lab and test results will
                depend on where you receive care and the types of results you
                want to access. If you receive care at both Mann-Grandstaff VA
                Medical Center and another VA health facility, you may need to
                use both web portals.
              </p>
              <h3>If you receive care at Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center</h3>
              <p>
                You’ll use My VA Health’s Labs and Vitals tool to view some of
                your VA lab and test results from providers at Mann-Grandstaff.
                These include results like blood tests as well as microbiology,
                pathology, radiology, and cardiology reports.
              </p>
              <h3>If you receive care at any other VA medical center</h3>
              <p>
                You&apos;ll use My HealtheVet&apos;s Labs and Tests tool to:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  View your VA chemistry/hematology lab and test results from VA
                  medical centers other than Mann-Grandstaff. These include
                  results like blood tests, blood cell count, and tests for
                  blood sugar and liver function.
                </li>
                <li>Add results from non-VA health care providers and labs.</li>
