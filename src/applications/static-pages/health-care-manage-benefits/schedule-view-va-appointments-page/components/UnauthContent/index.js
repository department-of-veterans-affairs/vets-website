    <h2>How do I know if my VA health facility uses online scheduling?</h2>
    <p>
      Online scheduling is available at all VA health facilities except those in
      these locations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Indianapolis, IN</li>
      <li>Manila, Philippines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Online scheduling is available for some types of
      health services. We hope to expand the types of appointments and health
      services available through online scheduling in the future.
    </p>
    <h2>What types of VA health appointments can I schedule online?</h2>
    <p>
      It depends on the VA health facility where you’re receiving care. You can
      typically schedule an appointment online for the types of care that don’t
      require a referral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you’re signed in to the appointments tool, you’ll find the types of
      appointments you can schedule online at your registered health facility.
      You can also check with the facility where you receive care about
      scheduling appointments online.

      of VA, you can use this tool to submit appointment requests. You must
      receive prior approval from us before getting care from a community
