    <h2>How can these appointment tools help me manage my care?</h2>
    <p>
      These tools offer a secure, online way to schedule, view, and organize
      your VA and community care appointments. The appointments you can schedule
      online depend on your facility, the type of health service, and other
      factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>You can use these tools to:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Schedule some of your VA health appointments online</li>
      <li>Request approved community care appointments online</li>
      <li>Cancel appointments made online</li>
      <li>View appointments on your health calendar</li>
      <li>
        Find the location of the VA or community care facility for your
        appointments
      </li>
      <li>Print a list of your future appointments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Am I eligible to use these tools?</h2>
    <p>
      You can use these tools if you meet all of the requirements listed below.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I know if my VA health facility uses online scheduling?</h2>
    <p>
      Online scheduling is available at all VA facilities except those in these
      2 locations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Indianapolis, IN</li>
      <li>Manila, Philippines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Online scheduling is available for some types of
      health services. We hope to expand the types of appointments and health
      services available through online scheduling in the future.
    </p>
    <h2>Can I use these tools to schedule community (non-VA) appointments?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes. If you’re eligible to receive care from a community provider outside
      of VA, you can use these tools to submit appointment requests. You must
      receive prior approval from us before getting care from a community
      provider.
