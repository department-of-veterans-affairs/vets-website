            Veterans who are enrolled in VA health care can now answer more
            questions about their military service history. We’ll use this
            information to determine if you may have had exposure to any toxins
            or other hazards. And we’ll determine if we’ll place you in a higher
            priority group. This may affect how much (if anything) you’ll have
            to pay towards the cost of your care

            These questions are only available on our PDF form at this time. If
            you want to answer these questions, you’ll need to submit your form
            by mail or in person.
