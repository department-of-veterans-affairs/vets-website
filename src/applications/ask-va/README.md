# Ask VA on VA.gov

This application uuses the `ask_va_api` middleware to interact with the Azure/MSFT-stack application from the AskVA team (a.k.a. AVA CRM). That API is a facade (technically, it's middleware) for the APIs that were developed on the Dynamics / PowerApps platform on the government Azure cloud.
