          <h3 slot="headline">Who can I send messages to?</h3>
          <p>
            You can send messages to VA providers and staff on your care team.
            Most VA providers use this tool—but some don’t. Ask your care team
            if sending messages is the best way to communicate with them.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can’t use this tool with community care providers or other
            non-VA providers.
          </p>

          <h4>Sending messages to your care team</h4>
          <p>
            When you start a new message, you’ll need to select a care team to
            send it to. Your list of care teams will depend on where you get
            care.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your care team isn’t in your list of teams to send messages to,
            contact your VA health facility and ask to speak to the My
            HealtheVet coordinator or secure messaging administrator.

          <h4>Getting replies from different providers</h4>
          <p>
            You may get a reply from the VA provider you sent a message to. Or
            you may get a reply from a different provider or staff member on
            your care team.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, we may decide that a different team needs to answer
            your questions. We’ll reassign the conversation to that team so that
            they can reply to you. But only VA providers and staff will be able
            to read your messages.
