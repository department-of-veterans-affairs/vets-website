/**  This component is used to display an alert to users who are associated with a facility that is transitioning to Cerner. 
The alert will display custom content that will have to be updated per facility.

"isCerner" flag that is contained in a facility object derived from the user profile is considered to be not fully reliable 
during transition periods and may not be updated timely. Drupal CMS is currently the source of truth for this information. 
Facility info is pulled from the drupalStaticData reducer. 

The facility info is then compared to the user's facilities to determine if the user is associated with a transitioning facility.
Since neither Drupal nor user profile do not contain transition dates and those are flexible, the alert will be displayed based on the feature flag toggles.

Once the facility ehr is updated to 'cerner' in Drupal CMS, the facility is considered to be transitioned to Cerner and this alert will be disregarded regardless of the feature flag toggles.
After transitioning, need to ensure that CernerFacilityAlert is displayed to users who are associated with Cerner facilities.
