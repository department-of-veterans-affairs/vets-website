// The following are the user stories that need to be retained as part of this implementation:
// ~As a user, I can add multiple files to the VaFileInputMultiple~
// - As a user that is adding an encrypted file, the component will detect that the file is encrypted and if so show a password input.
// - As a user, if I try to submit an encrypted file without a password, I will see the error "Please provide a password to decrypt this file"
// - As a user, that is adding a non-encrypted file, the component will detect that the file is not encrypted and not show the password input.
// - As a user, each file I add will have a VaSelect that asks "What type of document is this?" (options are populated by FILE_TYPES found in 'utils/validations' of the application)
// - As a user, if I try to submit a file without a file type, I will see the error "Please select a file type."
// - As a user, if I try to input a file in which file mime type and signature do not match I will see the error "The file extension doesnâ€™t match the file format. Please choose a different file." and not be able to submit the file
// - As a user, if I try to input a file that is not one of the valid file types (which are found in FILE_TYPES 'utils/validations') I will see the error "Please choose a file from one of the accepted types."
// - As a user, if I try to input a pdf that is above 99MB or another file type above 50MB I will get the following: "The file you selected is larger than the ${maxSize}MB maximum file size and could not be added."
// - As a user, if I try to input a file that is 0MB I will get the following: "The file you selected is empty. Files uploaded must be larger than 0B."
// - As a user, if I add files that fit all these requirements and therefore have no error messages I can submit them. On submit the current uploading files modal shows a progressbar with submission progress and then if successful a success va-alert above the VaFileInputMultiple.
// - As a user, I can click Remove and be shown a confirm modal. On the modal I can delete or cancel. If I delete the file, the other files will retain their correct data.
// - As a user, I see the label "Upload additional evidence" with the hint" You can upload a .pdf, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, or .txt file. Your file should be no larger than 50 MB (non-PDF) or 150 MB (PDF only)."

// IMMEDIATE:
// - Make the select required
// - Make the password required
// - BUG: If [0] has no password, [1] has a password, and I delete [0] and [0] loses its password

// Questions:
// Why are there no examples of how to use this? The storybook shows no way to capture the child value
