# [CST][ENG] Migrate va-file-input v43.0.2 to va-file-input-multiple latest version

## Goal
Replace the Claims Status Application's current file input implementation with the `va-file-input-multiple` latest version  while preserving all existing functionality and ensuring no user experience regression.

## Background
The current implementation of the file input uses the `va-file-input` v43.0.2 and extra logic to create a way for users to input multiple files at once. v43 of the `va-file-input` is the USWDS v1 while v44 of the file `va-file-input` is the USWDS v3. This large change resulted in no longer being able to use the same extra logic to allow users to input multiple files at once. It was requested that there was a `va-file-input-multiple` that implemented this multiple input ability within a web component. This was created, but there was multiple issues that were then attempted to be resolved. Both engineers from the team that worked on the component and fixes are no longer on that team.

## Prerequisites
- [x] Platform encryption boolean solution validated - Confirmed that though the encryption prop logic requires a lot of external logic that could have been included in the component itself (including determining if the file is encrypted and validation of if the password is inputted) the boolean does conditionally show the password input field.

## Tasks
- [x] Validate that we can access data from `va-file-input-multiple` children inputs
- [x] Outline current file input functionality: file-input-multiple-implementation.md (found in src/applications/claims-status/components/claim-files-tab/file-input-multiple/file-input-multiple-user-stories.md)
- [ ] Write unit tests for `va-file-input-multiple` implementation in alignment with file-input-multiple-implementation.md (found in src/applications/claims-status/components/claim-files-tab/file-input-multiple/file-input-multiple-user-stories.md) to enable test driven development and to validate component functionality
- [ ] Use tests to get several versions of file input multiple each focused on a different functionality area working as expected:
    - [ ] basic file input multiple
    - [ ] password input (including validation)
    - [ ] document type select (including validation)
    - [ ] submission
- [ ] Combine those file input multiples to get all functionality working as expected
- [ ] Refine solution
- [ ] Ensure it is submitting correctly to vets-api
- [ ] Add e2e testing
- [ ] Create PR

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All existing functionality is preserved and no user experience regressions exist - this doc outlines the current user stories: file-input-multiple-implementation.md (found in src/applications/claims-status/components/claim-files-tab/file-input-multiple/file-input-multiple-user-stories.md)
- [ ] File submission works with existing backend endpoints
