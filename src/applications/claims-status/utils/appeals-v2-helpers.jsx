              new options in 2019 for Veterans seeking review of VA decisions.
              RAMP is a program that allows you to opt in to two of the new
              "lanes" for review before the new law takes effect. For more
              information, review the fact sheet that was enclosed with the

              will withdraw all of your eligible appeals and instead review your
