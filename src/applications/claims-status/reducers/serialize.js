// This does a few things:
// 1) Grabs all of the supporting documents associated with tracked items and
//    embeds them within their respective tracked items in a new `documents`
//    key that has been added to each tracked item
// 2) Gets a new array of supporting documents that only includes the documents
//    that are not associated with any tracked items. These items should
//    already be embedded in their respective tracked items anyways, so they
//    are no longer needed
// 3) Performs any additional necessary transforms on supporting document and
//    tracked item data, such as replacing display names and adding date
//    attributes
