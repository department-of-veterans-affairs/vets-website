        Recurring income is income you receive on a regular basis, rather than a
        one-time payment. Here are some example recurring income sources:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wages from a job</li>
        <li>
          Pensions, including those from Philippine Veterans Affairs Office
        </li>
        <li>Retirement (military, civil service, railroad, private)</li>
        <li>Other benefits (Black Lung, unemployment)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This doesn’t include interest or dividends from financial accounts or
        income from property you own.
      </p>
