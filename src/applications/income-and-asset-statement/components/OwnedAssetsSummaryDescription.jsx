        In this section, we’ll ask about properties and any income you receive
        from physical assets that you solely own or that you own with someone
        else. Here’s what you’ll need to prepare.

        Types of property to report
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you receive any income from a physical asset or own a physical asset,
        you’ll need to report it in this form. Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rental property</li>
        <li>Farm income</li>
        <li>Business income</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="vads-u-font-size--h3 vads-u-margin-top--0">
        Establish the asset’s value
      </h2>
      <p>
        To establish the asset’s value, subtract any unpaid mortgage or debt
        from the asset’s value. Only report the value of your share of the
        asset.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> To establish the market value of a property, use
        a licensed appraiser, realtor, or trusted online estimate. Don’t use a
        property tax assessment.
