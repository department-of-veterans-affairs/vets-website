        <p>
          If you have an issue or complaint about a school or training facility
          that’s eligible to receive GI Bill benefits, you can submit feedback
          to VA. You can submit feedback to us if your school isn’t following
          the Principles of Excellence guidelines or if you have any other
          concerns or issues you’d like to raise with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can choose to submit your feedback anonymously or on behalf of
          someone else. We share all information with the school, but if you
          submit feedback anonymously we won’t share your name with the school.

                directly about your feedback.
