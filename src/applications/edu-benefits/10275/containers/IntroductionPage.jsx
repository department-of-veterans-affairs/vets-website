        The Principles of Excellence (PoE) were created under Executive Order
        13607 to help schools that serve Veterans, service members, and their
        families provide clear, honest information and strong student support.
        <br />

        <p>
          If your school is approved for VA education benefits, we encourage you
          to commit to the PoE. Signing up shows your dedication to transparency
          and supporting students who use VA benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your school has more than one campus, your main campus should
          submit <strong>one</strong> form that lists <strong>all</strong>{' '}
          locations and a point of contact for each. Extension campuses will be
          automatically included in this agreement based on your facility code,
          and you will be able to select any branch campuses associated with
          your institution, as applicable.{' '}

          {' '}
          This is a voluntary, ongoing commitment. Once you sign up, your
          participation remains valid unless you change or withdraw it. If
          you’re not making changes, you don’t need to take further action.
