      <p>
        The purpose of this form is to ensure compliance with legal restrictions
        on conflicts of interest related to VA educational assistance benefits.
        These rules help ensure adherence to federal laws by preventing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          VA and State Approving Agency (SAA) employees from having any
          financial interest in a school operated for profit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Covered VA employees from receiving services from a school operated
          for profit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Payment of VA educational assistance to any person who is an owner or
          officer of the institution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Veterans and other individuals eligible for VA educational assistance
          from certifying their own enrollment or training at any proprietary
          school. A proprietary school is a privately owned, profit-driven
          institution that offers educational programs or training.
        </li>
