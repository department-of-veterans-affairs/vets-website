          Affairs (VA) and the State Approving Agency (SAA) from owning any
          interest in a for-profit educational institution. These employees
          cannot receive wages, salary, dividends, profits, or gifts from
          for-profit schools. The law also prohibits VA employees from receiving
          any services from these schools. The VA may waive these restrictions

          or eligible persons.
