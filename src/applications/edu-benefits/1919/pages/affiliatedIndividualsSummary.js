              Veterans Affairs (VA) and the State Approving Agency (SAA) from
              owning any interest in a for-profit educational institution. These

              from receiving any services from these schools. The VA may waive
              these restrictions if it determines that no harm will result to
              the government, Veterans, or eligible persons.
