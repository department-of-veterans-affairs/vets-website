          On the next several pages, you will provide all 85/15 calculations for
          your institution. Submit calculations for all approved programs listed
          on your most recent WEAMS-22-1998 Report. List every program and

          Review the calculation instructions we provided before proceeding. You
          may find it helpful to open the instructions in a new tab while

          your calculations.
