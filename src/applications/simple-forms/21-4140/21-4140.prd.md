# Income Verification for Disability Benefits

Employment Questionnaire (VA Form 21-4140)

You may need to complete the Income Verification for Disability Benefits form if you receive Individual Unemployability (IU) benefits. These benefits cover service-connected disabilities that prevent you from working. The VA checks IU recipients every year. They match wage data with the Social Security Administration (SSA). This ensures you still qualify for benefits. If the match shows you earned income above the poverty line while receiving IU benefits, the VA will ask you to complete this form. Be sure to complete and return this form within 65 days of the notice. If you don’t respond, you may lose your IU benefits.

## What to know before you fill out this form

You'll need your Social Security number or your VA file number.  If you were employed, you will need to provide information about your employer and employment. After you submit this form, we will review and advise you of the decision and your options.
