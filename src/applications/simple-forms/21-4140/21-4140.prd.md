# Income Verification for Disability Benefits

Employment Questionnaire (VA Form 21-4140)

Use VA Form 21-4140 if we asked you to verify your employment status because you currently received Individual Unemployment (IU) disability service-connected conditions

## What to know before you fill out this form

* You need to submit this form because the Social Security Administration reported that you earned income while received IU benefits
* You need to complete this form within 65 days of the notice you received
* You’ll need your Social Security number or your VA file number
* After you submit this form we’ll review it and advise you of your decision and your options

## What you’ll need to report

Depending on your income source, you’ll also need to provide the following:

* Information about any employers or employment you’ve had in the past 12 months
* **If your income was from your spouse and taxes were filed jointly**, documentation of the income source, such as a spouse’s W-2 or wage and tax statement
* **If you’re no longer employed**, evidence of when you stopped working, such as a statement from your former employer with the last day you worked
* **If you’re currently employed but haven’t worked for a continuous year**, evidence of your employment status, such as a statement from your employer with the dates you worked
