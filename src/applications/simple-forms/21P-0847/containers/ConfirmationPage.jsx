    <p>
      Once a substitution request is granted, the substitute claimant must
      complete any action required by law or regulation within the time period
      remaining for the original claimant to take such action on the date of
      their death. The substitute has the same rights as would have applied to
      the original claimant had they not died, including the rights regarding
      hearings, representation, legacy appeals, decision review options for a
      claim not finally adjudicated, and submission of evidence. The substitue
      also has the right to request a decision review of a deceased claimantâ€™s
      claim that is not yet final.

      If you change your mind and do not want to be the substitute for the
      deceased claimant, write us a letter to revoke your request.
