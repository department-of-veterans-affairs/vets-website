# Profile - Representative Status

This tool allows a va user to go to home page, select `Profile` from the drop down under their name.
The Profile page then directs the user to various cards with information that pertains to them. By selecting the link in the card `Accredited representative or VSO` a veteran will learn if they have a representative or VSO.

You can learn more about this service [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/product-documentation/representative-status-widget/product-outline-representative-status.md).
