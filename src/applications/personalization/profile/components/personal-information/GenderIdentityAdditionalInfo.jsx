        Sharing your gender identity in your VA.gov profile is optional. If you
        get health care at VA, this information can help your care team better
        assess your health needs and risks. But you should know that any
        information you share in your VA.gov profile goes into your VA-wide
        records. Veterans Benefits Administration and National Cemetery
        Administration staff can also access this information.
      </p>

      <p>
        We follow strict security and privacy practices to keep your personal
        information secure. But if you want to share your gender identity in
        your health records only, talk with your health care team.
