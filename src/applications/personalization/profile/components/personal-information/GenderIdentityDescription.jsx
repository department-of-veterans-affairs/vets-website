          Sharing your gender identity in your VA.gov profile is optional. If
          you get health care at VA, this information can help your care team
          better assess your health needs and risks.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          But you should know that any information you share in your VA.gov
          profile goes into your VA-wide records. VA staff outside of the health
          care system may be able to read this information.

        <p>
          We follow strict security and privacy practices to keep your personal
          information secure. But if you want to share your gender identity in
          your health records only, talk with your health care team.
