# Purpose and overview

The authenticated experience team wants to work towards a concierge-like VA experience, one that puts veterans' and other customers at the center of the interaction. 

My VA aims to meet this expectation by providing Veterans with a direct route to their most critical tasks and updates.

# Developing locally

1. Make sure you have the `vets-website` repo cloned and installed. I prefer `yarn`, but you can also use `npm`.
```
git clone git@github.com:department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website.git

cd vets-website/

yarn install
```

2. Start local server:
```
yarn watch --env entry=dashboard
```

3. Include mocked responses:
```
yarn mock-api --responses src/applications/personalization/dashboard/mocks/server.js
```

4. To simulate logged in status, copy and paste the following into your browser devtools:

```
localStorage.setItem('hasSession', true)
```
