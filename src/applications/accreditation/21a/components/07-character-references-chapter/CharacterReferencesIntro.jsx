      Over the next few pages, we will ask you to list at least three (no more
      than four) individuals who are not immediate family members and who have
      personal knowledge of your character and qualifications to serve as an
      attorney or claims agent. For each character reference, you will need to
      provide the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full name</li>
      <li>Address</li>
      <li>Primary phone number</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Your relationship to the reference</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You are encouraged to notify your character references that the Department
      of Veterans Affairs Office of General Counsel will be sending an inquiry
      for a character reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the applicantâ€™s responsibility to ensure that responses are provided
      to our office. If we do not receive at least three responses, your
      application will not be processed.
