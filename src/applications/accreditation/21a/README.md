### ðŸš¨WIP Form 21AðŸš¨
This sub-application is incomplete and its development has been paused. It is dependency-free from the `representative` application that it might eventually live under.

This tool allows attorneys or claims agents to start the application (Fowm 21A) process to become a VA-accredited representative. 

## How to run locally

### Run vets-api locally

1. Open up the project in **VSCode** or in a **terminal instance** by cding into the vets-api project.
2. Once in the vets-api project use the following commands:

   - If you just did a git pull or this is your first time running the project run this command

   ```code block
   bundle install
   ```

   - Run vets-api locally

   ```code block
   foreman start -m all=1,clamd=0,freshclam=0
   ```

### Run vets-website locally

1. Open up the project in **VSCode** or in a **terminal instance** by cding into the vets-website project.
2. The Form 21A currently lives on the Accredited Representative Portal so you'll need to run 2 different applications.
3. Take a look at [src/applications/accredited-representative-portal/manifest.json](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/applications/accredited-representative-portal/manifest.json) to see what the service name is that youâ€™ll need for the vets-website yarn watch command and for the url

   - Service Name: entryName (representative)
   - Localhost Url: rootUrl (EX: <http://localhost:3001/representative/>)

4. Take a look at [src/applications/accreditation/21a/manifest.json](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/applications/accreditation/21a/manifest.json) to see what the service name is that youâ€™ll need for the vets-website yarn watch command and for the url

   - Service Name: entryName (representative-21a)
   - Localhost Url: rootUrl (EX: <http://localhost:3001/representative/accreditation/attorney-claims-agent-form-21a>)
5. Once in the vets-website project use the following commands:

   - If you just did a git pull or this is your first time running the project run this command

   ```code block
   yarn install
   ```

   - Run vets-website locally

   ```code block
   yarn watch --env entry=auth,static-pages,login-page,terms-of-use,verify,representative,representative-21a
   ```

### How to login into localhost with mocked-auth and fill out an application

1. Go to <http://localhost:3001/sign-in/mocked-auth>
2. Select ID.me from the drop down list and click the â€˜Sign in with mocked authenticationâ€™ button.
3. Select a profile from the drop down (EX: vets.gov.user+228@gmail.com) and click the â€˜Continue signing inâ€™ button.
4. Youâ€™ll be logged into localhost and the page will spin since we are only running certain services. Change the url to <http://localhost:3001/representative/> and you will be directed to the Accredited Representative Portal home page.
   > If the page spins you might have a feature flag disabled. Make sure that the feature flag `accredited_representative_portal_frontend` is enabled.
5. Change the url to <http://localhost:3001/representative/accreditation/attorney-claims-agent-form-21a> and you will be directed to the Form 21A Introduction Page.
   > If the page spins you might have a feature flag disabled. Make sure that the feature flag `accredited_representative_portal_form_21a` is enabled.
   > Unfortunetly there is not yet a button that takes you to this page from the Accredited Representative Portal home page so you have to type in the url to get there.
