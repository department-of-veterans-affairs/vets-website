                <strong>Veteran Services Organizations (VSOs) </strong>
                are recognized and accredited by the VA and offer services free
                of charge for Veterans and their families. VSOs help gather
                evidence to submit a Fully Developed Claim and can correspond
                with the VA about a claim on behalf of a Veteran.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Attorneys</strong> can provide similar services as VSOs,
                but usually specialize in appeals. They can provide more
                dedicated help throughout the claims process. Attorneys charge a
                fee for their services.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Claims agents</strong> can provide similar services as
                VSOs, but they function independently. Claims agents will charge
                a fee for their services.
