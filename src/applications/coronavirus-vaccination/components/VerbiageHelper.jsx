        Thank you for signing up to stay informed about COVID-19 vaccines at VA.
        When we have new information to share about our COVID-19 plans and your
        vaccine options, we'll send you updates by email or text.

      <p>
        Your local VA health facility may also use the information you provided
        to determine when to contact you about getting a vaccine once your risk
        group becomes eligible. If you told us you plan to get a vaccine, your
        facility may contact you sooner. You can always change your mind about
        getting a vaccine. And you can submit a new form to update your
        information at any time.

        Yes. You don’t have to sign up to get a vaccine. When you’re eligible to
        get a vaccine, your local VA health facility will contact you to ask if
        you want one. But if you do sign up and tell us you plan to get a
        vaccine, your facility may contact you sooner.

        If you signed up before and want to update your information, you can

        At this time, we still have a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccines. And
        we must follow strict requirements for how to store and handle these
        vaccines. Because of this, we often need to bring Veterans in quickly to
        get a vaccine so we don’t waste any doses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contacting Veterans who we know plan to get a vaccine helps us do the
        most good with our limited supply.

        No. But when you provide this information, we can match your information
        to your Veteran records. We can then tell your local VA facility about
        your vaccine plans. If you signed up before and didn’t provide this
        information, you can submit a new form at any time.

            If someone calls you from VA and you don’t recognize the phone
            number, ask for a number to call them back. Then call your local VA

        Your facility may invite you to get a vaccine in different ways:
        <ul>
          <li>
            They may invite you to a large vaccination event, like a drive-thru
            clinic.
          </li>
          <li>They may offer you a specific date and time to get a vaccine.</li>
