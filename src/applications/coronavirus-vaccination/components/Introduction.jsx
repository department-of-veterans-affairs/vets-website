        <p>
          We’re working to get COVID-19 vaccines to Veterans as quickly and
          safely as possible based on CDC guidelines and available supply. We
          need your help to prepare. And we want to keep you informed at every
          step.

      <p>
        Sign up below to help us understand your interest in getting a vaccine.
        We’ll send you regular updates on how we’re providing vaccines across
        the country—and when you can get your vaccine if you want one. We’ll
        also offer information and answers to your questions along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> You don’t need to sign up to get a vaccine. And
        you can change your mind about getting a vaccine at any time. We’ll use
        the information you provide to understand your interest and communicate
        with you.
