          Can I submit other supporting documents if I answered questions about

        </h2>
        <p>
          Yes. If you answered questions about your military service history and
          may have had exposure to any toxins or other hazards while you were
          deployed or during active duty training or service, you can also send
          us a written statement with more information by mail.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s your choice whether you want to submit a written statement. We’ll
          use the information to confirm your military service history.
        </p>
        <p>Here’s what you can include in your written statement:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any toxins or hazards you were exposed to</li>
          <li>Month and year when you were exposed</li>
          <li>
            Type of activity or work you were doing when you were exposed (like
            basic training)
          </li>
          <li>
            And you’ll need to write your name and Social Security number on
            your statement.
          </li>
        </ul>
