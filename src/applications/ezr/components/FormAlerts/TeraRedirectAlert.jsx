        Veterans enrolled in VA health care and expansion of benefits
      </h2>
      <p>
        On <strong>March 5, 2024</strong>, we expanded health care to millions
        of Veterans.

      <p>
        Veterans who are enrolled in VA health care can now provide more
        information about their military service history. We’ll use this
        information to determine if you may have had exposure to any toxins or
        other hazards. And we’ll determine if we’ll place you in a higher
        priority group. This may affect how much (if anything) you’ll have to
        pay toward the cost of your care.
