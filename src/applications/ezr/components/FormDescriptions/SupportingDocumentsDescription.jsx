    <p>
      We recommend uploading supporting documents related to any toxins or other
      hazards you may have been exposed to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Itâ€™s your choice whether you want to upload any supporting documents. But
      they may help us confirm certain details about your service history and
      process your form faster.
    </p>
    <h4>Documents you can upload</h4>
    <p>
      Upload a document with information about what you may have been exposed
      to, the type of activity you were engaged in when you were exposed (like
      basic training), and where and when you may have been exposed (including
      the month and year).
    </p>
    <p>You can upload copies of any of these types of documents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your DD214, DD215, or other separation documents</li>
      <li>Any other service records</li>
      <li>Military orders or unit histories</li>
      <li>
        A written statement (like a personal statement or a buddy statement)
      </li>
      <li>
        Photos, journal entries, or news articles related to any toxins or other
        hazards you may have been exposed to
      </li>
    </ul>
