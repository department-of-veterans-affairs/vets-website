/**
 * Outputs to the console all the console.log()s called from the browser since
 *  the last client.printLogs() was called.
 *
 * NOTE: This only works from log level WARNING and above right now. This has to
 *  do with the selenium log level, methinks, and I'm not sure how to change that.
 *  To "log" from within the browser, use console.warn() for now.
 *  Also, this doesn't work with console.warn('foo:', foo). To output a variable,
 *  be sure to include it in a string template: console.warn(`foo: ${JSON.stringify(foo)}`)
 *  It's obnoxious, but that's the only way I've found that works well.
 *
 * @param {String} level     The level of logs to print. Note: This can cause
 *                           some logs to be skipped. For all log levels, See
 *                           https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Logging#log-levels
 *                           If no level is provided, all levels are output.
 * @param {bool}   printAll  Prints all the logs from 0 on. In case some logs
 *                           got skipped because of log level specificity.
