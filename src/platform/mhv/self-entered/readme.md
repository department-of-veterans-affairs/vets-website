# How to Use the `generateSEIPdf` Function and `MissingRecordsError` Component

This guide provides a detailed explanation of how to use the `generateSEIPdf` function to generate PDFs containing self-entered health information, as well as the `MissingRecordsError` component to display errors for domains that failed to load.

---

## Overview

The `generateSEIPdf` function:
1. Fetches self-entered health data using either a unified API or individual domain-specific APIs, based on a feature flag.
2. Processes the fetched data to identify failed health domains.
3. Creates a PDF report with the successfully retrieved data.
4. Returns a success status and a list of failed domains.

The `MissingRecordsError` component:
- Displays an error message with a list of human-readable domain names that failed to load.
- Can be used alongside the `generateSEIPdf` function to inform users about missing data.

### Why Are Failed Domains Important?

The SEI document aggregates self-entered health information across several domains (e.g., Allergies, Medications, Family History). Any domain that fails to load will result in incomplete information in the generated PDF. By identifying these failures:
- Users can be informed about missing data.
- Appropriate error handling and retry logic can be implemented for specific domains.
- Clinical relevance can be ensured (e.g., including "Medications" if "Allergies" fail).

## Key Features

1. **Feature Flag Support**: Allows toggling between unified API (`getAllSelfEnteredData`) and domain-specific APIs (`getSelfEnteredData`) for data fetching.
2. **Error Handling and Reporting**: Identifies failed domains and provides clear feedback to users using the `MissingRecordsError` component.
3. **PDF Generation**: Produces a standardized report with user details and self-entered health information.
4. **Integration with Redux**: Designed to work seamlessly with the Redux store for managing user profiles and feature flags.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Import the Function and Component

Import the `generateSEIPdf` function and `MissingRecordsError` component from the platform:

```javascript
import { generateSEIPdf, MissingRecordsError } from '@department-of-veterans-affairs/mhv/exports';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
```

---

### Step 2: Access the `userProfile` and Feature Flag from Redux

Retrieve the `userProfile` and feature flag (`useUnifiedSelfEnteredAPI`) from Redux using `useSelector`:

```javascript
const {
  user: { profile: userProfile },
} = useSelector(state => state);

const useUnifiedSelfEnteredAPI = useSelector(
  state =>
    state.featureToggles[
      FEATURE_FLAG_NAMES.mhvMedicalRecordsUseUnifiedSeiApi
    ],
);
```

---

### Step 3: Call the Function and Handle Errors

Call the `generateSEIPdf` function and use the `MissingRecordsError` component to display any failed domains.

#### Example Usage:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { generateSEIPdf, MissingRecordsError } from '@department-of-veterans-affairs/mhv/exports';

const GenerateSelfEnteredPdf = () => {
  const {
    user: { profile: userProfile },
  } = useSelector(state => state);

  const useUnifiedSelfEnteredAPI = useSelector(
    state =>
      state.featureToggles[
        FEATURE_FLAG_NAMES.mhvMedicalRecordsUseUnifiedSeiApi
      ],
  );

  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [failedDomains, setFailedDomains] = useState([]);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  const handleGeneratePdf = () => {
    setLoading(true);
    generateSEIPdf(userProfile, useUnifiedSelfEnteredAPI, false)
      .then(response => {
        setLoading(false);
        if (response.success) {
          setFailedDomains(response.failedDomains);
          alert('PDF generated successfully!');
        } else {
          setError('Failed to generate the PDF');
        }
      })
      .catch(err => {
        setLoading(false);
        setError(err.message);
      });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleGeneratePdf} disabled={loading}>
        {loading ? 'Generating PDF...' : 'Generate Self-Entered Information PDF'}
      </button>
      {error && <p>Error: {error}</p>}
      {failedDomains.length > 0 && (
        <MissingRecordsError
          documentType="Self-entered health information report"
          recordTypes={failedDomains}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default GenerateSelfEnteredPdf;
```

---

### Step 4: Returned Response Format

The `generateSEIPdf` function returns a promise that resolves to an object containing:
- `success`: Boolean indicating whether the PDF generation was successful.
- `failedDomains`: Array of human-readable domain names that failed to load.

#### Example Response (Success):

```javascript
{
  success: true,
  failedDomains: ['Allergies', 'Medications']
}
```

#### Example Response (Failure):

```javascript
{
  success: false,
  failedDomains: []
}
```

## Additional Notes

1. **Feature Flag**: 
   - When `useUnifiedSelfEnteredAPI` is `true`, the function uses `getAllSelfEnteredData` for unified data fetching.
   - When `false`, it falls back to `getSelfEnteredData`, fetching data for each domain individually.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - The `failedDomains` list identifies domains that failed to load.
   - Use the `MissingRecordsError` component to display these failed domains to users.

3. **PDF Content**:
   - Includes user details such as name and date of birth.
   - Organizes self-entered health information by domain.

4. **Special Domain Handling**:
   - If the "Allergies" domain fails but "Medications" does not, the function ensures "Medications" is marked as failed for clinical relevance.

5. **Redux Integration**:
   - The `userProfile` and feature flag are managed via Redux. Ensure the `FEATURE_FLAG_NAMES.mhvMedicalRecordsUseUnifiedSeiApi` flag is correctly configured.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Medical Records Module**: Allow users to download a PDF report of their self-entered health information for personal use or sharing with healthcare providers.
2. **Error Reporting**: Provide detailed feedback about missing data using the `MissingRecordsError` component.
