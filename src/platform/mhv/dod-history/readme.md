## How to Use

### Step 1: Import the Utility

Import the `generateMilitaryServicePdf` function from the shared exports module:

```javascript
import {
  generateMilitaryServicePdf,
} from '@department-of-veterans-affairs/mhv/exports';
```

### Step 2: Access the `userProfile` from Redux

Retrieve the `userProfile` from the Redux state using `useSelector`:

```javascript
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const {
  user: { profile: userProfile },
} = useSelector(state => state);
```

### Step 3: Generate a PDF

Call the `generateMilitaryServicePdf` function with the user's profile data as input. Handle the returned promise to manage loading states, display success messages, or handle errors.

#### Example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import {
  generateMilitaryServicePdf,
} from '@department-of-veterans-affairs/mhv/exports';

const GenerateMilitaryServicePdfExample = () => {
  const {
    user: { profile: userProfile },
  } = useSelector(state => state);

  const handleGeneratePdf = () => {
    // Show loading spinner or indicator
    console.log('Generating PDF...');

    generateMilitaryServicePdf(userProfile)
      .then(response => {
        // Hide loading spinner or indicator
        console.log('PDF generated successfully:', response);

        if (response.success) {
          // Show success message to the user
          alert('Your military service PDF has been generated successfully!');
        } else {
          // Handle error case
          console.error('PDF generation failed:', response.error);
          alert('Failed to generate the military service PDF. Please try again.');
        }
      })
      .catch(error => {
        // Hide loading spinner or indicator
        console.error('Error generating PDF:', error);

        // Show error message to the user
        alert('An unexpected error occurred while generating the PDF.');
      });
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleGeneratePdf}>Generate Military Service PDF</button>
    </>
  );
};

export default GenerateMilitaryServicePdfExample;
```

---

## Returned Response Format

The `generateMilitaryServicePdf` function returns a promise that resolves to an object indicating the success or failure of the PDF generation process.

#### Success Response:

```javascript
{
  success: true,
}
```

#### Error Response:

```javascript
{
  success: false,
  error: [Error Object], // Detailed error information
}
```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the `userProfile` object contains all required data for generating the PDF.
  - Required fields in `userProfile.userFullName`: `first`, `last` (optional: `middle`, `suffix`)
  - Required field in `userProfile`: `dob`
  - The user must also have an edipi number, which can be found on the user profile, in order to retrieve this report. 
- The utility internally uses the `makePdf` function to handle PDF creation.
- The generated PDF will be named and formatted consistently for military service records.

## Example Use Cases

1. **User Profile Pages**: Allow users to generate a PDF of their military service records directly from their profile page.
2. **Records Downloads**: Enable users to download their military service PDF as part of their personal records.
