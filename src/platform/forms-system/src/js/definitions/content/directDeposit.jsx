      provides a list of Veteran-friendly banks and credit unions. They’ll work
      with you to set up an account, or help you qualify for an account, so you
      can use direct deposit.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get started, call one of the participating banks or credit unions
      listed on the VBBP website. Be sure to mention the Veterans Benefits
      Banking Program.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The Department of the Treasury requires us to make
      electronic payments. If you don’t want to use direct deposit, you’ll need
      to call the Department of the Treasury at{' '}
      <Telephone contact={CONTACTS.TESC} />. Ask to talk with a representative
      who handles waiver requests. They can answer any questions or concerns you
      may have.
