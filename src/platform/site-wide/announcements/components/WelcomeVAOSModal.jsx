        Welcome to the new VA.gov online scheduling tool
      </h1>
      <p>
        The VA appointments tool has been redesigned based on feedback from
        Veterans like you. You can now view, schedule, and cancel all your
        appointments in one place on VA.gov.
      </p>
      <p>
        To view your past appointments, you can go back to the old appointments
        tool. Youâ€™ll find a link to it at the bottom of the page in the new
        tool.

        Continue to your VA appointments
