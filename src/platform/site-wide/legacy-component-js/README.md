# Overview

This folder contains javascript necessary for some legacy components to run. Specifically, markup that contains classes for the deprecated usa-accordion, additional-info, and sidenav. The code in this folder is a direct port from [this source](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools/tree/master/packages/formation/js). 

Eventually this will get removed after all remaining instances in vets-website using these classes have been updated to use VADS web components. 

## Known Use Cases
- [Sitewide footer mobile links](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/platform/site-wide/va-footer/components/MobileLinks.jsx)


## Issue Tracking
Once [epic 3568](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/3568) is completed, this directory can be removed.
