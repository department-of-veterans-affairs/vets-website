I hereby appoint the Attorney General of the United States and the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs and their designees as my Attorneys-in-fact to take all necessary and appropriate actions in order to recover and receive all or part of the amount herein assigned. I hereby authorize the VA to disclose, to my attorney and to any third party or administrative agency who may be responsible for payment of the cost of medical services provided to me, information from my medical records as necessary to verify my claim. Further, I hereby authorize any such third party or administrative agency to disclose to the VA any information regarding my claim.</p>
