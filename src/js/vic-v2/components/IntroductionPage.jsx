              <p>Sign in to Vets.gov with either an existing DS Logon (the same one you use for eBenefits or MilConnect) or an ID.me account.</p>
              <p>If you don’t have an account on Vets.gov, you can create one using ID.me, our Veteran-owned, trusted technology partner that provides the strongest identity verification system available.</p>
              <p>When you’re signed in, we can verify your identity to make sure you’re you. This also helps to keep your information safe, and prevent fraud and identity theft.</p>
              <p>Verifying your identity is a one-time process that’ll take about 5-10 minutes. Once you’ve gone through
the identity process, you won't need to do it again. To verify your identity through ID.me, you’ll need:</p>

              <p>You can complete the application without signing in, but it’ll take us longer to verify your identity. This will delay a decision on your application. The fastest way to get your application processed is to sign in with a DS Logon or ID.me account.</p>
