          <h4>(Optional): Apply to the Physical Disability Board of Review (PDBR)</h4>
          <p>
            If you believe your disability rating for TBI, PTSD, or mental health conditions is too low, consider applying to the Physical Disability Board of Review (PDBR). The Department of Defense (DoD) created the PDBR specifically to review appeals about low disability ratings for Veterans discharged between 2001 and 2009. Many Veterans discharged during this time period were inaccurately given lower disability ratings than they deserved, especially if they suffered from TBI, PTSD, or mental health conditions. If you were discharged in this period and previously received a disability rating which you feel is too low, you are eligible to apply to the PDBR for review. The PDBR does not issue discharge upgrades—but if the PDBR finds that your disability rating was unjustly low, this may help you make your case to upgrade your discharge. Many Veterans in this situation choose to make a PDBR application before applying for a discharge upgrade. <a target="_blank" href="https://health.mil/PDBR">Learn more about PBDR reviews</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Conditions-and-Treatments/Physical-Disability/Disability-Evaluation/Physical-Disability-Board-of-Review/PDBR-Application-Process">Apply for a PBDR review</a>.

                  <p>If you have a discharge that is less than honorable, when you apply for VA benefits, it will trigger a review at VA. VA will review your record to determine if your service was "honorable for VA purposes."</p>

The VA handles these reviews on a case-by-case basis, and so they can take a long time — sometimes over a year. To access VA benefits, it helps to respond to this letter with information supporting your case. For example, if you’re asking VA to forgive your past behavior, provide evidence of positive steps you have taken in your life since your time in the service such as "buddy statements" or a certificate showing you've completed an drug rehabilitation program.</p>

                  <p>Many veterans with less than honorable discharges pursue both methods: a VA characterization of discharge review, and a DoD discharge upgrade. There is no reason not to pursue both at the same time.</p>
                  <p>If you experienced sexual assault or harassment while in the military or need mental health services related to PTSD or other mental health conditions linked to your service, you may qualify for VA health benefits without a VA characterization of discharge review or a discharge upgrade.</p>
