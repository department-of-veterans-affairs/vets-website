# Prescriptions Frontend

The react/redux frontend for the Vets.gov prescription refill project.

This is under active development!  If you would like to contribute, start by checking out our [issues](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ARx), or via [waffle](https://waffle.io/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website?search=rx).

## Background

This frontend pairs with the [prescriptions API](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/prescriptions-api), which will become an early piece of the [Vets.gov API Platform](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api).
