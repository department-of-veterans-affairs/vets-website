              <p className="first-of-type">VA looks at every claim carefully before making a decision. In some cases, we are able to decide quickly, but some claims are more complex and take more time to review.</p>
              <h2 className="estimation-header">Your estimated decision date is based on:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>The type of disability you claimed</li>
                <li>How many disabilities you claimed</li>
                <li>Whether there were any unusual circumstances</li>
                <li>How long it took VA to decide other claims like yours</li>
                <li>How long it takes VA to get supporting documents</li>
              </ul>
              <h2 className="estimation-header">Sometimes estimated dates change when:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>You upload optional evidence that needs to be processed</li>
                <li>You filed an additional claim that was consolidated with an existing claim</li>
                <li>VA determines additional evidence or information is needed to support your claim</li>
                <li>VA experiences an unexpected high volume of claims</li>
              </ul>
              <h2 className="estimation-header">When an estimated decision date isn't met:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>The above reasons sometimes result in your claim needing additional time that exceeds the estimated completion date. We are working to process your claim as quickly as possible.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2 className="estimation-header">When an estimated decision date isn’t given:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>We aren’t always able to give an estimate. This happens when there isn’t enough information to make an estimate. We will provide one once more information is gathered.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>You can help speed up the process by promptly and electronically uploading the documents requested by the VA.</p>
            <p>If you have questions, call VA at 1-855-574-7286, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET.</p>
