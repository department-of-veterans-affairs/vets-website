          We sent you a packet by U.S. mail that includes details of the decision on your claim. Please allow 7 to 10 business days for your packet to arrive before contacting a VA call center. If you haven’t received the packet with the full details of your claim decision yet, you can see your rating by going to your disability page in eBenefits. <a href="https://www.ebenefits.va.gov" target="_blank">Check your disability page in eBenefits for your rating</a>.</p>
        <h5 className="estimation-header">Next steps</h5>
        <p>If you agree with your rating, you don’t need to do anything else.</p>
        <p>If we decided that an issue you claimed wasn’t service connected, and you have new evidence that you haven’t submitted yet, you can ask VA to reopen your claim. <a href="/disability-benefits/apply/claim-types/reopened-claim/" target="_blank">Find out how to reopen your claim</a>.</p>
        <p>Has your condition gotten worse since you filed your claim? You can file a new claim for an increase in disability compensation. <a href="/disability-benefits/apply/claim-types/new-claim/" target="_blank">Find out how to file a new claim</a>.</p>
        <p>If you disagree with the decision on your claim, you can file an appeal. <a href="/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/" target="_blank">Learn more about filing an appeal</a>.</p>
