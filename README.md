# vets.gov - beta [![Build Status](https://dev.vets.gov/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=testing/vets-website/master)](http://jenkins.vetsgov-internal/job/department-of-veterans-affairs/job/vets-website/job/master/) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/coverage)

## What is this?

This is the combined frontend repository for www.vets.gov. With this repository, it is possible to
build all of the client-side (i.e., anything that gets downloaded to the browser) code for
www.vets.gov with the exception of some high sensitivity endpoints that require server side
interaction such as login.

As it is client side there are no secrets in this repository since, well, public secrets aren't
very secret.

## I want to...

| I want to...                             | Then you should...                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| clone the site and install dependencies  | `git clone https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website.git` followed by `cd vets-website`, then follow the instructions below to install node, npm and yarn if needed. Finally, run `yarn install` to fetch all the dependencies. Run `yarn install` anytime `package.json` changes. |
| fetch all dependencies                   | `yarn install`; run this any time `package.json` changes |
| Use the git hooks provided               | You can either copy the hooks as-is right now with `cp hooks/* .git/hooks` or make sure your git hooks by using a symbolic link to the hooks distributed with vets-website with `rm -rf .git/hooks && ln -s ../hooks .git/hooks`. On Linux, you may have to do `ln -rs` instead of just `-s`. |
| deploy the site                          | merge to master for `dev.vets.gov` and `staging.vets.gov`. Production deploys are executed by creating a release of vets-website via Jenkins. |
| update static content that is already on the site. | Find the corresponding file in `content/pages`. Make your edit. Send a PR. |
| add new static content to the site.      | Create new files at the right location in `content/pages`. Send a PR. |
| build the site with dev features enabled. | `npm run build`                          |
| build the production site (dev features disabled). | `npm run build -- --buildtype production` Note the extra `--` is required otherwise npm eats the buildtype argument instead of passing it on. |
| build the site with optimizitons (minification, chunking etc) on. | Set `NODE_ENV=production` before running build. |
| reset local environment (clean out node modules and runs npm install) | `npm run reset:env`                      |
| run the site for local development with automatic rebuilding of Javascript and sass | `npm run watch` then visit `http://localhost:3001/`. You may also set `buildtype` and `NODE_ENV` though setting `NODE_ENV` to production will make incremental builds slow. |
| run the site for local development with automatic rebuilding of code and styles for specific apps | `npm run watch -- --entry disability-benefits,static-pages`. Valid application names are in each app's `manifest.json` under `entryName` |
| run the site for local development with automatic rebuilding of code and styles for static content | `npm run watch:static`. This is equivalent to running `npm run watch -- --entry static-pages` |
| run the site so that devices on your local network can access it  | `npm run watch -- --host 0.0.0.0 --public 198.162.x.x:3001` Note that we use CORS to limit what hosts can access different APIs, so accessing with a `192.168.x.x` address may run into problems |
| run all tests | `npm run test` |
| run only unit tests | `npm run test:unit` |
| run all unit tests and watch | `npm run test:watch` |
| run only unit tests for a subset of tests | `npm run test:unit -- path/to/my/test.unit.spec.jsx` <br> or <br> `npm run test:unit -- --recursive 'path/to/my/**/*.unit.spec.js?(x)'` |
| run only e2e tests | Make sure the site is running locally (`npm run watch`) and run the tests with `npm run test:e2e` |
| run only e2e tests for a subset of tests | Make sure the site is running locally (`npm run watch`) and run the desired tests with `npm run test:e2e -- src/applications/edu-benefits/tests/1995/*.e2e.spec.js` (provide file paths) |
| run e2e tests in headless mode           | `npm run test:e2e:headless`              |
| run all linters                          | `npm run lint`                           |
| run only javascript linter               | `npm run lint:js`                        |
| run only sass linter                     | `npm run lint:sass`                      |
| run automated accessibility tests        | `npm run build && npm run test:accessibility` |
| run visual regression testing            | Start the site. Generate your baseline image set using `npm run test:visual:baseline`. Make your changes. Then run `npm run test:visual`.  |
| test for broken links                    | Build the site. Broken Link Checking is done via a Metalsmith plugin during build. Note that it only runs on *build* not watch. |
| add new npm modules                      | `yarn add my-module --dev`. There are no non-dev modules here. |
| get the latest json schema               | `yarn remove vets-json-schema; yarn add https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema.git#{latest commit hash}` |
| check test coverage                      | `npm run test:coverage`                  |
| run bundle analyzer on our production JS bundles | `npm run build-analyze`                  |
| generate a stats file for analysis by bundle analyzer | `NODE_ENV=production npm run build -- -- buildtype production --analyzer`                  |
| load the analyzer tool on a stats file  | `npm run analyze`                  |

## Directory structure

| Directory        | Description                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| assets           | Static assets such as images or fonts. These may get some optimization-style processing done on them, but in general files here are expected to show up directly in the output. |
| build            | Output of the site build. A subdirectory is generated per `buildtype` so `--buildtype=development` appears in `build/development`. This directory is suitable for synchronizing into S3 for deployment |
| config           | Contains config files for the site.      |
| content/pages    | Static content for the site. If a file is added here, it will appear on the website by default. |
| content/layouts  | Collection of layouts that can be used by content/pages. Must be html. No Markdown. |
| content/includes | Collection of HTML fragments shared between layouts. Must be html. No Markdown. |
| logs             | Directory for log output from build tools. Currently only used by nightwatch and selenium for end-to-end testing. |
| node\_modules    | install location of npm modules. Managed by npm. |
| script           | Scripts for building the repository. The most commonly used script is `build.js` which runs Metalsmith |
| src              | All of our application code, including styles and tests |

Inside the `src` directory, we have two folders `applications` and `platform`. `applications` contains the individual applications used on Vets.gov, typically associated with a particular URL. `platform` contains the shared code used by those applications: the platform we build applications on top of.

### Requirements

Users with government furnished equipment may not have admin account access. [These instructions might help](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Work%20Practices/Design/run_vets.gov_locally_for_designers.md).

The requirements for running this application are Node.js 8.10.0 and yarn 1.5.1

Once you have nvm installed you should now install node.js version 8.10.0 by running:

We use `nvm` to manage Node.js and other tools. Keeping your tools in sync with everyone else will reduce errors. To install please visit: https://github.com/creationix/nvm

> If you are on a mac and use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), you can install `nvm` by typing in the Terminal:
> ```bash
> brew update && brew install nvm
> ```
> _There will be some further instructions in the success message after install "finishes"._

Once you have `nvm` installed, you should install Node.js:


```bash
nvm install 8.10.0
```
_This will also install `npm`_


Once you have node.js 8.10.0 you should set as the default version for nvm, you do that by running:

```bash
nvm alias default 8.10.0
```

Next install Yarn:
```bash
npm i -g yarn@1.5.1
```
### Verify your local requirements are set

```bash
node --version // 8.10.0
yarn --version // 1.5.1
```

Once you use one of the correct commands above (like `npm run watch`), the site will be available locally by typing `localhost:3001` into your browser. If you get weird errors, try `yarn install` as your first step.

## How it all works

### Build
The build is abstracted by the command `npm run build` which really just exectues
`scripts/build.js` --  a simple Javscript program that configures Metalscript and Webpack
based on things in `config/`, commandline flags, and the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.

*WARNING: `--buildtype` and `NODE_ENV` are unrelated!*

`--buildtype` changes what constants are defined which enables/disables features from the code.

`NODE_ENV` changes the optimizations applies such as disabling React PropType checks and
enabling minification + javascript chunking.

(Note: The `NODE_ENV` env variable dependency is a questionable design choice. It should

#### Metalsmith -- Static content builds and top-level file watching.
The `build.js` script relies on [Metalsmith's Javascript
API](https://github.com/metalsmith/metalsmith#api) as the main build script. Metalscript,
at the core, is just a file watcher that runs a set of files through chain of plugins.
Using the Javascript API for Metalscript allows removal of tools like Grunt while also
enabling faster incremental builds because Metalsmith and Webpack can stay in memory.

Metalsmith's behavior is entirely defined by the plugins added, their configuration, and
their ordering.

The primary responsibility of Metalsmith is to process all the pages in `content/` and
static assets under `assets/` to produce output in `build/`.

With the exception of files under `build/${BUILDTYPE}/generated/` that are handled by webpack,
everything else is directly generated by metalsmith-plugins.

Refer to the (thorough) comments inside `build.js` for specifics.

#### Webpack -- Javascript and Sass processing. Outputs `build/generated`
Metalsmith invokes Webpack or [Webpack Dev
Server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) depending of it is in
build or watch mode.

Webpack's configuration is stored in `config/webpack.config.js` and declares a set of
loaders which are Webpack's version of plugins. The loaders are used to compile ES2015
to ES5 via Babel, and to process the sass into CSS.

Webpack is configured to create a bundle for each application, as defined in the manifest.json files
found in `src/applications`. There are three "special" bundles: `vendor`, which contains dependencies
shared across all bundles; `styles`, which has no JS and is used to create a common CSS file shared
across applications, and `static-pages`, which is the bundle used by all static pages.

Sass and styles are loaded *via Javascript*. Each entry file typically imports an appropriate
top-level sass file which the imports some shared variables and individual Sass files as needed.
Webpack then generates a separate css bundle for each of these entrypoints allowing
the site to have app-specific css.

### Watch mode
File watching and incremental building is important for developer efficiency, but it's
more complicated because, to be fast, each tool needs to keep its state between runs.
This is actually the driving reason NOT to use grunt or gulp because, fundametnally,
both those task runners would expect to restart either metalsmith or webpack on
file changes.

In our setup, we use the `metalsmith-watch` plugin as well as the
`metalsmith-webpack-dev-server` plugin to do file watching based on the separation of
duties listed earlier. The Webpack Dev Server also serves as the actual web server
endpoint that handles HTTP requests.

When a file chagnes in `content/\*` or `asset/\*`, whether and how it gets rebuilt
is dependent on the `metalsmith-watch` configuration.

If a 404 is incorrectly handled, that's a configuration problem with Webpack Dev Server.

Similarly, everything in `src/\*` is dependent on the webpack configuration.

Quirks:
* metalsmith-watch cannot do broken link detection during incrementals.
  * Webpack Dev Server uses an in-memory filesystem so nothing shows up in `build/${}/generated`
  * Visit `http://localhost:3001/webpack-dev-server` (no trailing slash!) to see the contents of generated files.

Overall, this runs pretty well.

### Unit Test -- Mocha
All unit tests are named with the suffix `.unit.spec.js` and live in `tests` directories inside
`src/applications` and `src/platform`. Keeping tests near application code keeps applications self contained
and allows easier switching the files relevant to particular features on Vets.gov.

Unit tests are done via `mocha` with the `chai` assertion library run directly via
the mocha test runner in Node.

Unfortunately, it also means there is no true `window` or `document` provided which
breaks `ReactTestUtils`'s simulate calls. To remedy, a fake `window` and
`document` are provided using `jsdom` and bootstrapped in `src/platform/testing/unit/mocha-setup.js`
which is required via `src/platform/testing/unit/mocha.opts`.

If you need to polyfill additional browser functionality, `mocha-setup.js` is the place to do that
globally. The `mocha-setup.js` file can be thought of as the init script for mocha tests.

Note that because mocha is running the test files directly, it needs to use
`babel-register` (see `compilers` option in `mocha.opts`) to execute babel on
the unittests. This is why babel configuration is kept in `.babelrc`, so it can
be shared between build and test.

### Static Webserver
The site comes bundled with a static webserver, which is used for serving the files of a certain build-type from the build directory. If there isn't already a server running on port `3001` as is the case with `npm run watch`, the static webserver will automatically be started during Nightwatch tests (E2E and Visual Regression) that will serve the files of the corresponding build.

#### Running the site in production
It is sometimes useful to ensure that a certain feature of the site will function correctly in a certain environment. For example, a common use case is to render a certain feature in all environments outside of production. In this case, it would be beneficial to ensure the production environment is not impacted. To locally run a production build of the website, follow these steps:

1. `NODE_ENV=production npm run build -- --buildtype=production`
    - This will generate the complete static website in `build/production`.
    - NOTE: You will likely see files already in the `build/development` directory. This contains the generated content files from Metalsmith, but unless you recently executed a development build, it most likely does not contain the Webpack-compiled assets (JS/CSS) which are served from memory and not written to the file system during the watch-task.
2. `node src/platform/testing/e2e/test-server.js --buildtype=production`
    - You should see console output indicating that a local webserver has started, which port it is running on, and for which build-type.

### End-to-end Test -- nightwatch

All end-to-end tests are under `test/\*` and are named with the suffix `.e2e.spec.js`.
All end-to-end tests are named with the suffix `.e2e.spec.js` and live in `tests` directories inside
`src/applications` and `src/platform`.

Nightwatch is being used for browser-based testing. By default, Chrome is used as the browser
for tests. On Jenkins, Headless Chrome is used.

Nightwatch is a wrapper on Selenium. It is configured in `config/nightwatch.js`.
To run a nightwatch test, 3 things need to execute:

  1. [A webserver with our site](#static-webserver)
  2. The selenium server (which will spawn browsers like PhanomJS)
  3. The nightwatch client that talks to the Selenium server

End-to-end tests do not need to be restricted exclusively to selenium style tests
(eg, navigate to this url, click this button, etc). At its core, it just a system
for starting up and controlling web browser.  For mocha tests that we want to
run on real browser, either because the tests is exercising browser quirks or because
the test requries features that jsdom does not provide, putting them into a
`e2e.spec.js` file is completely valid and good.

#### E2E Troubleshooting
Try running your `selenium` server manually:
```
$ java -jar <path to GitHub>/vets-website/node_modules/selenium-server/lib/runner/selenium-server-standalone-3.4.0.jar
```
and you should see:
```
04:35:15.862 INFO - Selenium Server is up and running
```
* Selenium requires **Java 8** to run

#### Executing Nightwatch Tests For a Certain Environment
A webserver is required for Nightwatch to execute. Locally, you will likely execute E2E tests while running the local development server via `npm run watch`, followed by `npm run test:e2e`.

However, it is sometimes useful to execute E2E tests for a certain build-type, which is done by first running a build for that build-type, then executing the tests with the build-type passed as an argument.

For example, to execute the E2E tests for Production:

1. `NODE_ENV=production npm run build -- --buildtype=production`
2. `BUILDTYPE=production npm run test:e2e`
    - The Nightwatch startup script will see that port `3001` is not blocked (as it would be by the watch-task), and will start a [static webserver](#static-webserver) for the production build.

### Visual Regression Testing
This is the second iteration of visual regression testing. It is useful to detect side effects or scope of visual changes.

VRT works by gathering the links for the site using the sitemap, then using Puppeteer to navigate throughout the site, capturing an image of each page that will either be used as the baseline for future comparisons or compared to the baseline. The developer must first create the baseline image set for comparisons (sometimes called the golden set), then after making their changes, run an additional task to execute the comparison. See the chart above for the commands.

There are some [limitations](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Work%20Practices/Engineering/Visual%20Regression%20Testing.md), one of which is that VRG only tests the page on the initial load on a single viewport - it does not interact with the page or resize the window. This means that if there are dynamic elements they will not be covered. If this is functionality that interests you, you are welcome to join a discussion about the next phase of VRG.

To run visual regression testing start the server in one terminal and execute the following commands

1. `npm run test:visual:baseline` - Create desktop baseline
1. `npm run test:visual` - Compare to desktop baselines
1. `npm run test:visual:baseline -- --mobile` - Create mobile baseline
1. `npm run test:visual -- --mobile` - Compare to Mobile baselines

All screenshots are available at `logs/visual-regression/[baseline | diff]/[mobile | desktop]`


### Automated Accessibility Testing -- aXe

All end-to-end tests should also run our accessibility checking tool, aXe. There's a Nightwatch command
written for this, which should be run for any page that you test in an end-to-end tests. We also run aXe
on all pages in the sitemap, to ensure 508 and WCAG compliance.

### Continuous Integration
Continuous integration and deployment is done via
[Jenkins CI](http://jenkins.vetsgov-internal/). All of the configuration
is stored in `Jenkinsfile`. The build runs within docker, which is configured
with the `Dockerfile`. You can run this container locally to debug any failed
builds:

```
  docker build -t vets-website:local .
  docker run -it --rm vets-website:local /bin/bash
  cd /application && npm run build && npm run test
```

Builds are triggered for PRs for all build types. The special branch name
`content/wip/.*`, will fail by default and not run any builds. This is to allow
rapid iteration on WIP content team work before builds are tested.

Tests are run over the production buildtype for all PRs. Tests should not
be tied to the build type. Instead, define a feature flag variable and
test both the enabled and disabled states. While a build type will either enable
or disable the feature in the UI, the tests will still run the feature's code
path despite the environment. This ensures that your component will function in
all builds regardless of the build type. The important distinction is that your
feature is still active within the code base, but the UI is either enabled or
disabled by the feature flag.
