# VA.gov [![Build Status](https://dev.vets.gov/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=testing/vets-website/master)](http://jenkins.vetsgov-internal/job/testing/job/vets-website/job/master/)

## What is this?

This is the front end repository for VA.gov. It contains application code and templates used across the site.

There are several repositories that contain the code and content used to build VA.gov. If you're looking to get started running VA.gov locally, you should read the [Getting Started](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/getting-started) documentation.

## Common commands

Once you have the site set up locally, these are some common commands you might find useful:

| I want to...                                  | Then you should...                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| fetch all dependencies                        | `yarn install`; run this any time `package.json` changes |
| build both static HTML pages and applications | `yarn build`                                             |
| run the webpack dev server                    | `yarn watch`                                             |

## Building `vets-website`

The `vets-website` build has two main functions:

1. Build the application assets (JS, CSS)
1. Create the static HTML pages

### Building applications

`vets-website` uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle application
assets.

To **build all applications**, run the following:

```sh
yarn build:webpack
```

To **recompile your application when you make changes**, run:

```sh
yarn watch
```

You can also **limit the applications Webpack builds** with `--env.entryname`:

```sh
yarn watch --env.entryname static-pages,auth
```

The `entryname` for your application can be found in its `manifest.json` file.

If you're developing a feature that requires the API, but can't or don't want to
run it locally, you can specify `--env.api`:

```sh
yarn watch --env.api https://dev-api.va.gov
```

**Note:** If you try to log on, ID.me will redirect you to the environment that
the API is set up for. So in the above example, you'd be **redirected back to
dev.va.gov.**

### Building static content

VA.gov is a static site with individual applications served up on certain pages.
When testing changes to static pages, or to see what your application looks like
on VA.gov, you'll need to build the static pages.

```sh
yarn build:content
```

**Pro tip:** To see the same landing page for your application as what will be
on VA.gov, run `yarn build:content` once to build the static HTML files, then
`yarn watch` to watch for changes in your application and serve the site via
`webpack-dev-server`. Any time run `yarn build:webpack` or `yarn watch`, the
static HTML pages from the `build:content` task will not be overwritten.

To **pull the latest Drupal content**, run:

```sh
yarn build:content --pull-drupal
```

**Note:** This requires access to the SOCKS proxy. If you do not have access to
the proxy, you can **fetch the latest cached version of the content** with the
following:

```sh
yarn fetch-drupal-cache
```

### Building both together

CI will build both applications and content with the following:

```sh
yarn build
```

## Running tests

### Unit tests

To **run all unit tests**, use:

```sh
yarn test:unit
```

If you want to **run only one test file**, you can provide the path to it:

```sh
yarn test:unit src/applications/path/to/test-file.unit.spec.js
```

To **run all tests for a folder in src/applications**, you can use app-folder:

```sh
yarn test:unit --app-folder hca
```

To **run all tests in a directory**, you can use a glob pattern:

```sh
yarn test:unit src/applications/path/to/tests/**/*.unit.spec.js*
```

To **run tests with some extra debugging info**, you can pass a log-level:

```sh
yarn test:unit --log-level debug
```

### End-to-end (E2E) / Browser tests

- E2E or browser tests primarily run in Cypress.
- Some older, existing tests run in Nightwatch, but those are deprecated.

To **open the Cypress test runner UI and run any tests within it**:

```sh
yarn cy:open
```

To **run Cypress tests from the command line**:

```sh
yarn cy:run
```

To **run specific Cypress tests from the command line**:

```sh
# Running one specific test.
yarn cy:run --spec "path/to/test-file.cypress.spec.js"

# Running multiple specific tests.
yarn cy:run --spec "path/to/test-a.cypress.spec.js,path/to/test-b.cypress.spec.js"

# Running tests that match a glob pattern.
yarn cy:run --spec "src/applications/my-app/tests/*"
yarn cy:run --spec "src/applications/my-app/tests/**/*"

# Running tests that match multiple glob patterns.
yarn cy:run --spec "src/applications/a/tests/**/*,src/applications/b/tests/**/*"
```

To **run Cypress tests from the command line on a specific browser**:

```sh
yarn cy:run --headless --browser chrome
yarn cy:run --headless --browser firefox

# Without --headless, the test runner will open and run the test.
yarn cy:run --browser chrome
yarn cy:run --browser firefox
```

**For other options with `yarn cy:run`,** [the same options for `cypress run` are applicable](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#Commands).

To **run Nightwatch tests**, you first need three things:

1. Install the Java JDK on MacOS (if needed):
   ```
   brew update
   brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk
   brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
   ```
1. `vets-website` served locally on port 3001
   - You can do this with `yarn watch`
1. `vets-api` to **NOT** be running
   - The browser tests will use a simple mock api on port 3000, but only if
     nothing is already attached to that port

```sh
yarn test:e2e
```

Just like with unit tests, you can also **specify the path to the test file**

```sh
yarn test:e2e src/applications/path/to/test-file.e2e.spec.js
```

## Running a mock API for local development

In separate terminal from your local dev server, run

```sh
yarn mock-api --responses path/to/responses.js
```

See the [mocker-api usage
documentation](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/mocker-api#usage) for how to use
the `responses.js`.

**If you need to log in**, go to your browser dev tools console and enter
`localStorage.setItem('hasSession', true)` and refresh the page. This will then
trigger a `/v0/user` call, which will then get the mocked response of a logged-in
user. (Assuming you've mocked that response, of course.)

Responses to common API requests, such as `/v0/user` and
`/v0/maintenance_windows`, you can use
[`src/platform/testing/local-dev-mock-api/common.js`](src/platform/testing/local-dev-mock-api/common.js)

```javascript
const commonResponses = require('src/platform/testing/local-dev-mock-api/common');

module.exports = {
  ...commonResponses,
  'GET path/to/endpoint': { foo: 'bar' },
};
```

## More commands

After a while, you may run into a less common task. We have a lot of commands
for doing very specific things.
