If you are a Servicemember with a disability, you may begin your claim for compensation 60 to 180 days before separation, retirement, or release from active duty or demobilization. BDD helps you receive your VA disability benefits sooner.

### Are you eligible for this program?

Yes, if:

-	You have a known separation date.
-	You have a separation date 60-180 days from now.

### Who is covered
You

### Available benefits
Disability compensation

### How it works
You must give your service treatment records to VA when you apply, and you must complete all phases of VA/DOD medical separation examination processes at point of separation, before your release from the military.

BDD is available nationwide and open to all Servicemembers on full-time active duty, including members of the National Guard and Reserve. Members of the Coast Guard may also participate.

**Exception:** If you are less than 60 days from separation, you can submit a [Quick Start claim](/disability-benefits/filing/active-duty/quick-start/).

### Learn more
If you are on a military installation, contact your local Transition Assistance Office or ACAP Center (Army only) to schedule an appointment to attend a VA benefits briefing and learn how to initiate your claim. You can also call VA toll free at 1-800-827-1000.
