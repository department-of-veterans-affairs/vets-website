The best time to start the process of filing a disability claim is while you are on active duty in predischarge status,. Processing times tend to be faster for claims submitted pre-separation than for those submitted after separation has occurred.

If you are in predischarge status, you may file a claim for disability compensation up to 180 days prior to separation or retirement from active duty or release from full-time Reserve or National Guard periods of duty.

If you are between 180 and 60 days from separation, you can begin the Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. From 59 days until separation, you can initiate the Quick Start program.


### Integrated Disability Evaluation System

The Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) Examination Templates page is used to determine a Servicemember's fitness for duty. If you are found medically unfit for duty, the IDES proposes a VA disability rating before you leave the service.
