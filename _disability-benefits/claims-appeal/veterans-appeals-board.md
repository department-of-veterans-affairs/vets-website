If you finalize your appeal to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals (also known as BVA or the “Board”) by filing a VA Form 9, your case will be reviewed by the Board, which is composed of attorneys and judges experienced in:

-	Veterans law
-	Reviewing appeals for VA benefits

#### Working with the Board of Veterans’ Appeals

-	The Board’s jurisdiction extends to all matters involving a decision by the secretary under a law that affects a provision of benefits to Veterans, their dependents, or their survivors.  
-	The Board makes final decisions on such appeals based on the entire record in the proceeding and upon consideration of all evidence and applicable provisions of law and regulation.  
-	Once the Board receives your claims file, the appeal will be formally placed on the Board’s docket. You will receive a letter from the Board notifying you when this has happened.  
-	The law requires that the Board review appeals in docket order unless unusual hardship or “other sufficient cause” has been shown to advance a case on the docket.  
  -	The date that VA received the Substantive Appeal (VA Form 9) determines the docket date of each case on appeal. 
  -	If applicable, you may submit brief, but complete, supporting documentation to the Board for advancing your case on the docket. This supporting documentation must factually demonstrate reasons for advancement. Examples of unusual hardship or other sufficient causes include severe financial problems (bankruptcy petition or home foreclosure notice); serious illness (physician’s statement, preferably with clinical findings); and advanced age of 75 years or more. 
-	If you elect a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) to represent you in your appeal, once your case is received and formally docketed at the Board, the claims file will be sent to your representative for review and submission of additional written arguments on your behalf before being sent to a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) for review.  
-	Once your docket date arrives, the Board will send your case to a VLJ for review and a decision regarding each issue on appeal. Upon consideration of all the evidence and applicable provisions of law and regulation, the VLJ will grant, remand, or deny each issue on appeal. The Board will notify you of its decision in writing.   
	**Grant:**  If an issue is granted, the case will be returned to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) for a rating decision implementing the Board’s grant.  
	**Remand:**  If the VLJ determines that further action is necessary to assist you with the development of an issue on appeal and to ensure the record is complete, the Board will return the case to the AOJ for further development. Once the AOJ has completed development, it will review the case. If any part of the decision remains unfavorable, the Board will perform a comprehensive review of the entire record, according to its place on the docket. 
	**Deny:**  If an issue is denied, and you want to pursue further action, you may proceed in any of the following ways:
         -	File a new claim with your regional office.
         -	File a motion asking the Board to reconsider your appeal. (There is no time limit to file this motion.)
         -	File a motion asking the Board to review your appeal again because there was clear and obvious error in its decision. (There is no time limit to file this motion, but it cannot be filed until after the Board decision becomes final.)
         -	File a Notice of Appeal with CAVC.

You may request an optional personal hearing before a VLJ who works at the Board. If you request an optional hearing, it will significantly delay a Board decision, because optional hearings take more time to schedule. Note that if you select an optional in-person or video teleconference hearing with a VLJ at the Board, the hearing will be scheduled at your regional office (or in Washington, DC, if you selected that location).
