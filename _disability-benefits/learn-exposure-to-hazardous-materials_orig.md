You may be eligible for disability compensation if you were exposed to certain chemical, physical, and environmental hazards during military service that resulted in disease or injury.

### Asbestos
Some service occupations, tasks, and workplaces make exposure to asbestos more likely. These include mining, milling, shipyards, insulation work, building demolition, carpentry, and construction. In addition, the manufacturing and installation of products such as flooring, roofing, cement sheet, and pipe products, and the servicing of friction products such as clutch facings and brake linings, make exposure to asbestos more likely. If you served in Iraq or other countries in that region, you could have been exposed to asbestos when older buildings were damaged, releasing the contaminant into the air.

### Contaminated Drinking Water at Camp Lejeune
Between August 1953 and January 1988, two on-base water-supply systems at Marine Corps Base in Lejeune, North Carolina, were contaminated with the volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene (TCE), a metal degreaser, and perchloroethylene (PCE), a dry cleaning agent. Benzene, vinyl chloride, and other compounds were also found to be contaminating the water-supply systems.

### Specific Environmental Hazards
You may have been exposed to environmental hazards at military installations during military service. These hazards include burn pits, particulate matter, chemical fires, and waste disposal pollution.

### Ionizing Radiation
You may have been exposed to ionizing radiation during military service if, for example, you participated in nuclear weapons testing. Certain diseases may be service connected if the disease occurred as a result of the radiation exposure.

### Mustard Gas
Mustard gas is a common term for sulfur mustard (Yperite) or nitrogen mustard. Lewisite, an organic compound containing arsenic, is another chemical agent.

### Project 112/SHAD
From 1962 to 1974 approximately 6,000 U.S. Servicemembers were involved in conducting chemical tests to defend against biological and chemical weapons threats.. Participation in these tests, known as Project 112 and Project SHAD, may have resulted in subsequent illnesses among Veterans, and may qualify a survivor of a Veteran who died from exposure to such chemical testing to certain VA benefits.

### Radiogenic Risk Activities
There are certain diseases that may be service connected if the disease occurred as a result of your participating in a radiation-risk activity. Examples of radiation-risk activities include serving or being a prisoner of war in Japan and participating in nuclear weapons testing.
