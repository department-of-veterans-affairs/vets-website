### What are the different types of claims processes?

##### VA has several types of claims processes, which depend on when a claim is submitted and if it filed before - or after - a Veteran’s separation from service.
Veterans, dependents of Veterans, and survivors of deceased Veterans can file a claim for benefits with the VA, just not for compensation for disability benefits. [right?]

###### This article describes the different types of claims processes filed after a Veteran separates from services.

##### 1. Standard claim

A standard claim is where the VA gathers evidence, on your behalf from public and private medical facilities to process the claim.

Only with the authorization from the person filing the claim, the VA will attempt to gather any evidence, including evidence not held by Federal agencies, listed in the claim.

Evidence not held by Federal agencies may include: medical records from private medical providers, private doctors' offices, State and local governments, current or former employers.

To help determine a standard claim decision for a disability, the VA may provide medical examinations or seek a medical opinion.

VA recommends the appointment of an accredited Veterans service officer to help with a claim process.

They will help gather the required medical records, collect evidence, and submit a fully developed claim by paper or online at a local regional Veterans Affairs office. An accredited Veterans Service Officer is a free service.

##### 2. Fully developed claim

A fully developed claim generally provides a faster decision than a standard claim regarding disability compensation, pension, and survivor benefit claims.

This requires providing all relevant records, identifying additional records that are easily obtainable by VA - such as private medical records, and certifying that there is no more evidence to submit. VA will only obtain records identified as relevant evidence to a claim. There is one year from the start of the claim to submit additional information - even if VA has made a determination.

VA will then review, process, and generally make a determination faster than it would with a standard claim.

At any time during a fully developed claim process, VA may switch from a fully developed claim process to a standard claim process if VA discovers additional evidence that was not in the originally submitted claim.

VA recommends the appointment of an accredited Veterans service officer to help with a claim process.
