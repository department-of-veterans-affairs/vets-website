### What are pre-discharge programs?

#### PreDischarge programs allow active duty service-members to file claims for disability compensation prior to separation, retirement, release from active duty, or demobilization.

Programs are different by the number of days servicemembers have left before separation.

1. #### Benefits delivery at discharge:
Service-members can submit a disability claim when they are between 60 to 180 days away from separation, retirement, release from active duty, or demobilization.

2. #### Quick start:
Service-members can submit a disability claim when they are 1 to 59 days away from separation, retirement, release from active duty, or demobilization.
