It is possible for your service-connected disability to cause or worsen another disability.  If this happens, you can file a Secondary Disability Claim to seek additional benefit.  This second disability may not otherwise be considered service connected.

**Example 1:**
A Veteran has a service-connected knee injury that makes him limp. He then develops arthritis in his hip. His arthritis didn’t start while he was serving. But because his knee injury is service connected, if VA finds it caused the arthritis in his hip, his arthritis may be found to be service connected, too. He could file a Secondary Claim for additional benefits.

**Example 2:**
A Veteran was in the Army for twenty years. While she was serving, she was diagnosed with hypertension. After her discharge, service connection was established for hypertension. She was then diagnosed with coronary artery disease related to her hypertension. Service connection for the Veteran’s coronary artery disease may be established via a Secondary Claim.
