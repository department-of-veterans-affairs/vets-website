A reopened claim is a claim filed for a benefit that was previously denied and is in a final status because a year passed since the VA decision without an appeal. VA cannot reopen these claims without new material evidence. New evidence is information that the VA has not previously considered in connection with the specific benefit claimed. Material evidence is information that is relevant to and has a direct bearing on the specific claimed benefit.

### Example 1

A Veteran was treated several times during service for pain in the right elbow. He filed a claim for service connection in 1989, but his claim could not be granted because no orthopedic abnormalities were found on VA examination. Two years later, his private physician x-rayed the elbow and noted arthritic changes in the joint. The Veteran submitted the new evidence to VA. Because it suggested a residual of his in-service elbow problems did exist, VA reopened his claim.

### Example 2

A Veteran was discharged from service in 1977. He filed an original claim for service connection for pes planus (flat foot) 20 years later. VA was unable to grant his claim because pes planus was never noted in the Veteran's service treatment records. In 2001, he attempted to reopen his claim by submitting a statement from his private physician confirming the diagnosis of pes planus. VA was unable to reopen the claim because, while the evidence was "new," it was not "material," in that it failed to demonstrate the Veteran was diagnosed with pes planus during service.
