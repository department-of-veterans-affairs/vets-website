A one-time or yearly allowance for reimbursement

### How it works

To receive annual payment, you must establish eligibility by August 1 of the year for which you claim payment. View the current [rate table](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/special_Benefit_Allowances_2012.asp) to determine the benefit amount. (**Note:** 2014 rate table is valid for 2016.) Additional clothing allowances may be provided if more than one prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, or skin medication, is used and/or it affects more than one type of clothing garment.

Submit VA Form 10-8678, Application for Annual Clothing Allowance, to the prosthetic representative at your local VA medical center. You can use the facility locator to find your nearest VA health-care facility. For more information, call VA toll free at 1-800-827-1000. VA collects applications throughout the year and holds them until the August 1 closing date.
