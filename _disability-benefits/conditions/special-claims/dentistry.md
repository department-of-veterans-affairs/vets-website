Certain Veterans may receive dental treatment from VA. VA dental care eligibility and Veteran dental care benefits are based on a number of factors. Both the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) may make decisions regarding dental benefits and treatment. The [Dental Benefits for Veterans fact sheet](http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/resources/publications/IB10-442_dental_benefits_for_veterans_2_14.pdf) describes dental eligibility criteria and has information to help Veterans understand their eligibility for VA dental care.
