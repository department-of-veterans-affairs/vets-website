### How it works

VA considers non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma to be related to exposure to Agent Orange. When you apply for benefits, VA will forego the normal requirement that you prove your illness is related to Agent Orange or that it began during—or became worse because of—your military service.

Learn more about [benefits related to Agent Orange exposure](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/benefits/index.asp).

#### Need help determining exposure?

VA will help you determine exposure to Agent Orange or other herbicides during military service after you [file a claim for compensation benefits](/disability-benefits/claims-process/).
