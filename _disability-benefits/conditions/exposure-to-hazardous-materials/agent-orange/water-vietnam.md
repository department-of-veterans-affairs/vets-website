<div markdown="1">
If you served on a Blue Water Navy ship on the coastal or inland waterways of Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975—and ever came ashore—VA presumes you were exposed to Agent Orange.

</div>
<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Are you eligible for compensation?

Yes, if:

- You are ill with one or more of [these diseases](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/) related to Agent Orange.
- Your military record shows that you were aboard one of the [U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/shiplist/index.asp) that operated in Vietnam, or
- You came ashore.

<br>

### Who is covered

You and your survivors

</div>

<div markdown="1">

### Available benefits:

- Compensation
- Health care
- An [Agent Orange Registry health exam](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/registry-health-exam/)

<hr>

### How it works:

You must prove you were aboard one of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships that entered Vietnam’s inland waterways. If your ship docked or landed crewmembers, you must be able to prove that you went ashore.

If you did not go ashore or serve aboard a ship that operated on the inland waterways of Vietnam, you must prove that you were otherwise exposed to Agent Orange during your military service in order to receive disability compensation for diseases related to this exposure. These claims are decided on a case-by-case basis.

**Exception:**<br>
If you’re a Blue Water Veteran with [non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/non-hodgkins/), you do not need to prove where you were exposed. VA recognizes non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma as related to service in Vietnam or its offshore waters during the Vietnam Era.
