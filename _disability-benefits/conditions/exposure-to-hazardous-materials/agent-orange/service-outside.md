If you were exposed to Agent Orange during your service and have a related disease, you can apply for disability compensation even if you did not serve in Vietnam or in the Korean Demilitarized Zone.

### Are you eligible for compensation?

Yes, if:

- You are ill with one or more of these [diseases related to Agent Orange](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/).
- Your service involved regular security duties on the fenced-in perimeters of bases in Thailand during the Vietnam Era, or
- You served in close proximity to areas where [herbicides were tested or stored outside of Vietnam](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/test-storage/), or
- You had regular and repeated contact with a contaminated [C-123 aircraft](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/c-123/), or

### How it works

You must prove you were exposed to Agent Orange during your military service to be eligible for service-connection for diseases that VA presumes are related to Agent Orange exposure.

**Exception:**<br>
If you’re a Blue Water Veteran with [non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/non-hodgkins/), you do not need to prove where you were exposed. VA recognizes non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma as related to service in Vietnam or its offshore waters during the Vietnam Era.
