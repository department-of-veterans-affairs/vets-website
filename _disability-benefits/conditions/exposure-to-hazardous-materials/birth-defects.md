Spina bifida is a birth defect in which the developing babyâ€™s spinal cord fails to develop properly. It can be caused by environmental factors. If you are a Veteran with qualifying service in South Vietnam or the Republic of Korea, and your child has spina bifida or certain other birth defects, he or she may be eligible for VA benefits.
