The U.S. military sprayed millions of gallons of Agent Orange on trees and vegetation during the Vietnam War. Several decades later, concerns about the health effects from these chemicals continue.

### Are you eligible for compensation?

You were exposed to Agent Orange during military service.

#### Who is covered

You or your dependents
</div>

#### How it works

[These diseases are a result of exposure to Agent Orange](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/). VA forgoes the normal requirement that you prove an illness began during or became worse because of your military service.

If you have a disease that is not on this list but you believe it is a result of Agent Orange exposure, you will need to prove your illness began during or became worse because of your military service.
