#### How it works

[These diseases are a result of exposure to Agent Orange](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposures-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/). VA forgoes the normal requirement that you prove an illness began during or became worse because of your military service.

If you have a disease that is not on this list but you believe it is a result of Agent Orange exposure, you will need to prove your illness began during or became worse because of your military service.
