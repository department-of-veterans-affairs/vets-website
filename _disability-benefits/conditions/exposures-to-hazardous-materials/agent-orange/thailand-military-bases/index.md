#### Available benefits
- Heath care benefits
- Compensation benefits
- An [Agent Orange Registry health exam](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposures-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/registry-health-exam/)


#### How it works
To receive benefits for [diseases associated with Agent Orange exposure](//disability-benefits/conditions/exposures-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/) based on Thailand service, VA requires documents indicating daily work duties, performance evaluation reports, or other credible evidence showing the required perimeter security duty (for example, as a dog handler, a member of a security squadron, a member of a military police unit, or other related duties indicating regular security activity on a fenced-in perimeter).
