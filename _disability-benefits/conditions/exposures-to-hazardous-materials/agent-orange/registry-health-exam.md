If you suspect you were exposed to Agent Orange or other herbicides during your military service, you can request a VA Agent Orange Registry health exam. Even if you don’t have a known illness, the exam could alert you to health problems that may be related to herbicide exposure. Your participation also helps VA better understand and serve those affected by Agent Orange–related health problems.

Contact your local [VA Environmental Health Coordinator](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/coordinators.asp) if you are interested in getting an Agent Orange Registry health exam.

### How it works

Contact your VA Environmental Health Coordinator to [make an appointment for your exam](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/coordinators.asp).

This comprehensive health exam is free to eligible Veterans and includes:

- Your exposure history
- Your medical history
- A physical exam
- Medical tests that may be needed

A VA health professional will discuss your results with you and will follow up with a letter detailing your results.

Important points about the Agent Orange Registry health exam:

- It is not a disability compensation exam, nor is it required for other VA benefits. If you want to be considered for disability compensation, [you must file a claim](/disability-benefits/get/).
- You do not need to enroll in VA’s health care system to receive a registry health exam.
- The exam is based on your recollection of service, not on your military records.
- The exam will not confirm exposure to Agent Orange.
- You can receive additional, free Registry exams if new problems develop.
- Veterans' family members are not eligible for an Agent Orange Registry health exam.
