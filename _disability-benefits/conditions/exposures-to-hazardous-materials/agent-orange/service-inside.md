If you served in Vietnam, including aboard a [ship on the inland waterways](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposures-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/navy-coast-guard/), for any length of time between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, or in the Korean Demilitarized Zone between April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971, VA presumes you were exposed to Agent Orange.

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Are you eligible for compensation?

Yes, if:

You are ill with one or more of [these diseases](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposures-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/) related to Agent Orange.

#### Who is covered
You and your survivors

</div>

<div markdown="1">

#### Available benefits

- Compensation
- Health care
- An [Agent Orange Registry health exam](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposures-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/registry-health-exam/)


#### How it works

Check the list of [U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/shiplist/list.asp) that operated in Vietnam to confirm whether your service aboard a ship allows VA to concede that you were exposed to Agent Orange.
