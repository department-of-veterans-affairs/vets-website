If you were exposed to Agent Orange during your service and have a related disease, you can apply for disability compensation even if you did not serve in Vietnam or the DMZ in Korea.

</div>

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Are you eligible for compensation?

Yes, if:

- You are ill with one, or more, of these [diseases related to Agent Orange](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposures-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/).
- Your service involved regular security duties on the fenced-in perimeters of bases in Thailand during the Vietnam War Era, or
- You served in close proximity to areas where [herbicides were tested or stored outside of Vietnam](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposures-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/test-storage/), or
- You had regular and repeated contact with a contaminated [C-123 aircraft](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposures-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/c-123/), or
- You were associated during your service with projects to test, dispose of, or store Agent Orange.

#### Who is covered

You and your survivors
</div>

<div markdown="1">
#### Available benefits

- Compensation
- Health care
- An [Agent Orange Registry health exam](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposures-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/registry-health-exam/)

#### How it works

You must prove you were exposed to Agent Orange during your military service to be eligible for service-connection for diseases that VA presumes are related to Agent Orange exposure.

**Exception:** If you’re a Blue Water Veteran with [non-Hodgkin's lymphoma](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/conditions/exposures-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/non-hodgkins/), you do not need to prove where you were exposed. VA recognizes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as related to service in Vietnam or its offshore waters during the Vietnam Era.
