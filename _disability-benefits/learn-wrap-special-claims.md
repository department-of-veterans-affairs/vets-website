# What are special claims?

##### Compensation is not always based on an in-service event. Additionally, other benefits may be available after disability compensation has been awarded. An overview of these VA benefits is provided below, along with a link to additional information.


1. #### Title 38 U.S.C. 1151 Claims:
VA may provide compensation for injuries incurred or aggravated while receiving care from VA, such as medical treatment or vocational rehabilitation.

2. #### Automobile Allowance:
VA may provide Veterans with a one-time allowance to purchase a new or used car to accommodate a service-connected disability. This benefit is available to Veterans with certain severe service-connected disabilities, such as loss of, or permanent loss of use of, a hand or foot. This benefit can also be used to purchase adaptive equipment.

3. #### Birth Defects/Spina Bifida:
VA may provide a tax-free monetary allowance to children with Spina Bifida or certain birth defects born to women who served in the Republic of Vietnam or served in or near the demilitarization zone in Korea during certain time periods.

4. #### Clothing Allowance:
VA may provide an annual clothing allowance to Veterans who use a prosthetic or orthopedic device (including a wheelchair) because of a service-connected disability, or has a service-connected skin condition and uses a medication that causes irreparable damage to outer garments.

5. #### Convalescence:
VA may grant a temporary 100 percent disability compensation rating to recover from surgery or immobilization of a joint by a cast without surgery for a service-connected disability.

6. #### Dentistry:
Dental benefits are provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) according to law. In some instances, VA is authorized to provide extensive dental care, while in other cases treatment may be limited.

7. #### Hospitalization:
VA may grant a temporary 100% disability compensation rating to a Veteran who is hospitalized for more than 21 days for a service-connected disability.

8. #### Individual Unemployability:
VA may pay disability compensation at the 100% rate to certain Veterans who are unable to maintain substantially gainful employment as a result of service-connected disabilities, even though VA has not rated their service-connected disabilities at the total level.

9. #### Prestabilization:
VA may grant a temporary 12-month 50 or 100 percent initial rating to a Veteran who recently separated from service and has an unstable disability and is in need and cannot be self-sufficient.
