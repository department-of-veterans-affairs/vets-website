After you [file your disability benefits claim](/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/), you may be asked to go to a VA claim exam. This is also known as a compensation and pension (C&P) exam.

This is a type of medical evaluation to help determine the [rating for your disability](/disability-benefits/claims-process/ratings/). You may also be asked to come in for a VA claim exam if you appeal your disability benefits decision.

Claim exams are not like a normal doctor’s visit because you’re not there for treatment or diagnosis. Some things to know about a VA claim exam:

-	The examiner will look at only the service-connected conditions you have claimed and any related conditions to help VA determine your disability rating.
-	The examiner will ask you a standardized series of questions about your injury or illness. These set questions are from the [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)]( http://benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_ListByDBQFormName.asp), so the process may feel methodical.
-	The doctor may also send you for other necessary tests, such as an X-ray or blood work.

In some cases, VA will not require a VA claim exam to rate your disability because you have enough medical evidence in your file for VA to make a determination.

If you’re in the [appeals process](/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/), you may also be asked to come in for a VA claim exam.

### How long will the appointment take?

The amount of time you spend at your exam depends on how complicated your condition is. For example, the required questions for a documented knee injury might take only five minutes to get through, while an examination for a mental-health condition could take between two and four hours.

### Who will examine me?

The examiner may be a VA clinician or a private-sector clinician who VA has contracted to perform the exam. You can also have your own doctor [examine you and fill out the form](http://benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_veteraninstruct.asp).

The examiner does not determine your disability rating. He or she will provide evidence to VA claims processors so they can then determine your rating using the exam as well as your medical and military records.

After your VA claim exam, it takes VA an average of two weeks to send you a letter with your rating decision.

### Don’t miss your exam appointment

VA will contact you by phone to schedule the exam using the phone number you’ve provided in [eBenefits] (https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage). If VA cannot contact you by phone, we will follow up with an appointment letter sent via U.S. mail.

*It is incredibly important that you go to your appointment.* Missing your exam can cause VA to deny your claim. This is because the exam is part of the evidence that will be used to rate your overall disability.

If you can’t make your appointment, let VA know immediately so you can reschedule the appointment—but understand that this may delay your claim.

To reschedule your appointment you may:

-	Call 1-800-827-1000
-	Contact VA through an [online chat] (https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/chat/chatstart.aspx?domain=1010ez), or
-	Visit your nearest [benefits regional office](https://www.vets.gov/facility-locator/).

### Keep in touch

It’s important that your contact information be up to date in [eBenefits] (https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage); otherwise VA cannot notify you when your appointment has been scheduled.

#### Common questions

##### What information will the VA claims processor have?

He or she can see the medical records you have submitted, statements you and others have provided about your claim, and your military medical and personnel records. If you have new non-VA medical records that have not been submitted to VA, such as records for a recent surgery, bring them to the exam.

##### Will I get my exam results at the VA claim exam?

No. Within a few days, the clinician will write a report and submit it as part of your claim. VA will use that report, along with your other medical and military records, to make a decision about your claim.

If you would like a copy of the final report, visit [MyHealtheVet](https://www.myhealth.va.gov) or call VA at 1-800-827-1000.

##### What happens after the exam?

VA will review all of the evidence in your file, and then send you a decision notice, including details about your exam rating, You should get that about two weeks after the exam.

##### What can happen if I do not go to my VA claim exam?

VA may determine your disability benefit based on what evidence it already has—which may not be enough. However, if you have “good cause” not to attend, including an illness or hospitalization; serious illness or injury of someone in your immediate family; bad weather conditions; or a previously scheduled and paid-for commitment, such as a vacation, then missing your exam will not affect your compensation or rating. You do, however, need to notify VA on your reasons why you cannot attend.
