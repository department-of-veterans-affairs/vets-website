A presumed disability is a diagnosed disability that VA considers to be related to a Veteran's service because of the circumstances of the Veteran's military service.

This designation usually applies to conditions that are the result of a [specific hazardous exposure](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposures-to-hazardous-materials/) or a [chronic disease that appears within one year after discharge](/disability-benefits/get/filing/one-year/).
