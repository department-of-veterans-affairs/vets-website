#### Why use the standard claim process?

If you want VA to assist you in gathering evidence to support your claim, you should file a standard claim. With your approval, VA will gather needed evidence, listed in your claim, including information not held by federal agencies. This may include medical records from:

 - private medical providers
 - private doctors' offices
 - state and local governments
 - current or former employers

 </div>

#### Evidence Requirements

VA will seek to validate your claim with a variety documents, including:

- Medical evidence of a current physical or mental disability
- Evidence of an event, injury, or disease while you were in service

**Note:** A standard claim will generally take longer to process than a [Fully Developed Claim](/disability-benefits/claims-process/claim-types/fully-developed-claim/).
