If you are in predischarge status between 1 and 59 days before separation, retirement, or release from active duty or demobilization, Quick Start allows you to submit a claim for disability compensation.

### Are you eligible for benefits?

-	Your separation date is 1 to 59 days away.

#### Available benefits

Expedited status decision on your disability claim

#### How it works

By submitting your disability compensation claim before discharge, you can receive VA disability benefits as soon as possible after separation, retirement, or demobilization.

You must submit your service-treatment records to VA when you submit your claim, and you must complete all phases of the VA/DOD medical separation examination process at your point of separation and before you are released from the military.
