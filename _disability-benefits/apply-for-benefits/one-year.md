If you experience symptoms of certain diseases, such as hypertension, arthritis, diabetes, and peptic ulcers, within a year of separation from active service, you may be eligible for disability benefits. If symptoms appear within a year of separation, even though they were not present during military service, VA may presume service connection. See the [complete list of diseases](http://www.benefits.va.gov/warms/docs/regs/38CFR/BOOKB/PART3/S3_309.doc).

### Are you eligible for compensation?

Yes, if:

-	You have a disease that is at least 10% disabling within one year after separation from service.
-	The disease is listed in [Title 38, Code of Federal Regulation, 3.09(a)](http://www.benefits.va.gov/warms/docs/regs/38CFR/BOOKB/PART3/S3_309.doc).
-	You were discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.

### How it works

-	The evidence must show that the disease is at least 10% disabling. For example, you may be taking medication for hypertension.
-	The evidence must show that the disease appeared within one year after separation from service.

**Exception:** The requirement that the disease must have appeared within one year after separation from service does not apply to the following:

-	Hansen’s disease: within three years after separation
-	Tuberculosis: within three years after separation
-	Multiple sclerosis: within seven years after separation
-	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease: any time after separation
