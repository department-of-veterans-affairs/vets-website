Choose one of three ways:

1.	Apply online, using [eBenefits]( https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=disability-compensation), or

2.	Get help from an [accredited representative](/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/help/index.html), or

3.	Go to a [VA regional office](http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/offices.asp) and have a VA employee assist you.


**Note:** Active-duty Servicemembers should learn about [predischarge claims](/disability-benefits/claims-process/claim-types/predischarge-claim/index.html).
