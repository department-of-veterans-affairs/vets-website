# TODO

plan:

- update to not use feature flip until this gets sorted
  - disable in production using evn.isProduction
- create a (debug) page that still uses the feature flip, create a shorten url for that
- attach redux state to the window just for our app so we can see what is going in safari
- catch all prototype
