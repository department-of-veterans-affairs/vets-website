# Veterans spoke, we listened—VA.gov is changing

<div class="va-introtext">

We’re updating VA.gov in a few weeks. We listened to your feedback, and we tested new features and navigation with more than 1,800 Veterans.

[See preview of changes](#preview-screenshot)

## What you told us
* It's hard to bounce through multiple VA websites to find the information or tool I need.
* It's hard to sift through pages of dense content to find what I’m looking for.
* It's frustrating to have multiple login credentials to access my online tools.
## Changes you’ll see on VA.gov
* __Easier to find what you need, in one place.__ We consolidated a few VA websites to provide direct access to your most frequently used tools. You may still get redirected from VA.gov to another site for certain transactions in the near term. But in the future, we’ll integrate more tools from other VA websites into VA.gov, so you have one place to access the benefits you’ve earned.
* __Easier to understand.__ The information and tools you told us you use most often will be accessible from the home page or within a few clicks from the home page. And in plain language, so you know exactly where you’re going and what you need to do.
* __Just one account needed.__ Already have a DS Logon or My HealtheVet account? Log in to VA.gov with your existing account to securely access access all of your benefits and services. If you don’t have an account, you can create one using ID.me, a VA trusted technology partner who helps keep your personal information safe.

The new VA.gov is a first step in the VA's Digital Modernization journey. In the months and years ahead, we’ll continue to listen, learn and update the site with your feedback, and create digital tools and services to better support your needs.
