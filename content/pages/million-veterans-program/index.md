Be a part of advancing health care—and leave a legacy for future generations—by [enrolling in the Million Veteran Program (MVP)](/million-veterans-program/enroll). When you partner with MVP, you’re helping researchers study how genes affect health so they can find new ways to treat and prevent Veterans’ health issues. Join more than 500,000 of your fellow Veterans from around the country who’ve already signed up.

## Why be a part of MVP?

When you take part in MVP, you make a real difference in the lives of Veterans and others facing serious health issues.

[VA research](http://www.research.va.gov/for_veterans/default.cfm) has led to major advancements in how artificial limbs work, the creation of the nicotine patch, the first liver transplant, and more. Researchers continue working hard to find new and better ways to identify, treat, and prevent diseases.

### Veterans in the program say they wanted to be a part of MVP to:

-	Keep giving back to their fellow Veterans and others
-	Help find better ways to prevent and treat diseases that have affected their family and friends
-	Be involved in advancing medical research

### Get started with MVP

Just take these 3 simple steps:
1. Make sure you’re enrolled in VA health care. If you’re not, [apply now for VA health care](/healthcare/apply/).

2. Make an appointment at an MVP enrollment site, where you’ll fill out some forms to show that you agree to be a part of MVP and give permission for your information to be used in the program’s research.
