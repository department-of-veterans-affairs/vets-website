<div class="va-introtext">

If you got injured or became sick while on active military service, you may be eligible for monthly VA disability payments. A disability can be a physical illness or injury (like cancer or damage to a knee) or a mental-health condition (like anxiety or PTSD). 
Even if your disability didn’t appear until years after your service ended, or if your service worsened a condition you had before joining the military, you may qualify for disability payments. Find out if you can get VA disability compensation.
