<div class="va-introtext">

After you file your disability benefits claim, we may ask you to have a claim exam (also known as a compensation and pension, or C&P, exam). 

This exam will help us rate your disability. Your rating will be based on how severe your disability is—and will affect how much disability compensation you’ll receive. Compensation may include things like monthly payments and enrollment in the VA health care program.

##### Be sure not to miss your scheduled exam.

If you miss your exam, we may not be able to reschedule you right away, and your claim may be delayed while you wait for a new appointment. Or, if you don’t reschedule, we may need to rate your claim “as-is.” This means we’ll base our decision about your disability benefits only on the evidence we have in your file, which may not be enough.

### Does everyone who files a claim need to have a VA claim exam?

No. We’ll ask you to have a claim exam only if we need more information to decide your claim. 

If you have enough medical evidence in your file to support your claim, we won't ask you to have a claim exam. Medical evidence may include doctor and hospital reports, test results, and other documents.

### How to schedule your exam

#### How will you contact me to schedule the exam?

The staff at your local VA medical center or a local doctor’s office that we partner with will contact you. They’ll either send you a letter by mail with the date and time of your exam, or call you to find a time that works for you.

Make sure both the VA regional office and the VA medical center near you have your up-to-date address, phone number, and email address so you get your exam notice in time.

#### What should I do when I receive my exam letter or phone call?

Call the number provided right away to confirm the time and location of your exam. It’s important not to miss your scheduled exam, so you’ll want to double check that you have the right place and time.

#### What if I can’t make it to the scheduled exam?

If you can’t make it to your appointment, let us know right away. You can reschedule, but this may delay your claim.

#### To reschedule your appointment: 

- Call 1-800-827-1000, **or**
- Go to your nearest regional benefit office. <br>
  [Find your local regional benefit office](https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/division.asp?dnum=3&isFlash=0).	


### What should I bring to my VA claim exam?

Bring to your exam any new non-VA medical records that you haven't given us yet. These might include records from a recent surgery or illness. 


### What should I do if I disagree with your decision on my claim?

If you disagree with our decision, you can appeal it. The decision notice will have instructions on how to file an appeal. [File an appeal now](/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/).
