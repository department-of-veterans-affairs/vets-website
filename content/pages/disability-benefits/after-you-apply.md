### How long does it take VA to make a decision?

<div class="call-out" markdown="0">

<h3 style="padding:0">121.8 days</h3>
<p style="padding:0">This was the average time it took us to process disability-related claims in January 2017.</p>

</div>

#### The amount of time it takes to review your claim depends on:

- The type of claim you filed
- How many injuries or disabilities you claimed and how complex they are
- How long it takes us to collect the evidence needed to decide your claim

### What should I do while I wait?

You don't need to do anything unless we send you a letter asking for more information. If we schedule any exams for you, be sure not to miss them.

### What happens after I apply?

<ol class="process">
<li class="step one">

#### Claim Received

You’ll see a notice from us in your claims list within about 1 hour if you applied online with VONAPP Direct Connect. If you applied through the U.S. mail, you’ll need to allow for mailing time plus 1 week before you get a note telling you we have your claim.

</li>

<li class="step two">

#### Initial Review

A Veterans Service Representative (VSR) will review your claim. It’ll move to step 3 if we don’t need any more evidence to support it.

</li>

<li class="step three">

#### Evidence Gathering, Review, and Decision

During this step, the VSR will do 3 things:

- Ask for evidence from you, health care providers, governmental agencies, or others
- Review the evidence
- Make a decision

If we need more evidence during the review, your claim may return to this step more than once.

</li>

<li class="step four">
 
#### Preparation for Notification

We’ll get your entire claim decision packet ready to be mailed.

</li>

<li class="step last five">

#### Claim Complete

We’ll send you a packet by U.S. mail that includes details of the decision on your claim. Please allow 7 to 10 business days for your packet to arrive before contacting a VA call center.

</li>
</ol>

### What should I do if I disagree with your decision?

If you disagree with our decision, you can appeal it. The decision notice will have instructions on how to file an appeal. [File an appeal now](/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/).
