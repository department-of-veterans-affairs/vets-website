  <p>We're launching a new tool so you can file for increased disability compensation online.</p>
  <div class="feature">
    <strong>To use this tool, all of these must be true:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You've already filed a claim for disability benefits</li>
      <li>You have a service-connected disability that's gotten worse</li>
      <li>You're signed in to your premium My HealtheVet or DS Logon account. (If you don't have a verified account, you can create an ID.me account to complete the verification process.)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>If you meet the above requirements, and you’re interested in trying out our new tool, please give us your email address below. We’ll contact you to schedule a time to show you the tool and the process of filing a claim for increase online.</p>
