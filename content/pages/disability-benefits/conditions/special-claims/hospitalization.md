### How it works

If you were not hospitalized at a VA facility, you should provide the hospital discharge summary showing the length of stay and cause for hospitalization when filing your claim.

**Example**
A Veteran with a 40% service-connected disability rating for diabetes mellitus was hospitalized at a VA facility after lapsing into a diabetic coma. He required 25 days of hospitalization due to the coma and associated infections. VA temporarily raised his rating to 100% for the period of his hospitalization. After this period, his disability rating reverted to 40%.
