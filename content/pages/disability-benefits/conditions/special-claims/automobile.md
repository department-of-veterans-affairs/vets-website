Do you have a disability (damage to your body or mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work) caused by your service in the military that prevents you from driving? If yes, you may be able to get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits). 

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Can I get disability compensation from VA?

Yes, if your disability is linked to service in the military (called a service-connected disability) **and** your service-connected disability includes at least 1 of the following:
  - Loss, or permanent (long-lasting) loss of use, of 1 or both feet
  - Loss, or permanent loss of use, of 1 or both hands
  - Permanent decreased vision in both eyes: 20/200 vision or less in your better eye with glasses, or greater than 20/200 vision but with a visual field defect that has reduced your peripheral vision to 20 degrees or less in your better eye
  - A severe burn injury
  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (a disease that affects the nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord and leads to loss of muscle control that gets worse over time)
  - Ankylosis (a stiffness or locking of a joint caused by bones fusing together) in 1 or both knees or hips (**Note:** This qualifies you for an adaptive-equipment grant only)

### Who's covered?

- Veterans
- Servicemembers
</div>

### What kind of disability benefits can I get?

- A 1-time payment of $20,114.34 to help you buy a specially equipped vehicle
- Possibly 1 or more adaptive-equipment grants to change a vehicle with power steering, brakes, seats, windows, or lift equipment to help you with getting into and out of the vehicle

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits and get our approval *before* buying a vehicle or adaptive equipment. You can apply for—and use—either grant before or after military discharge.

For the 1-time payment to help you buy a specially equipped vehicle, we'll pay the vehicle's seller directly. For the adaptive-equipment grant, we may pay you or we may pay the seller of the equipment directly.  

When you apply, you'll need to show that your disability is service connected or is treated as if service connected under 38 U.S.C. 1151. [Learn more about 38 U.S.C. 1151](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/title-38-USC-1151/).

You'll also need to complete VA Form 21-4502: Application for Automobile or Other Conveyance and Adaptive Equipment.
[Download VA Form 21-4502](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-4502-ARE.pdf). 

If you qualify for adaptive equipment only (for example, you have a service-connected disability due to ankylosis of the knees or hips), you should complete VA Form 10-1394: Application for Adaptive Equipment—Motor Vehicle.
