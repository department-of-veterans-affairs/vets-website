If you have a service-connected disability that prevents you from driving an automobile or other conveyance, you may be eligible for a one-time payment of $20,235.20 toward buying a specially outfitted vehicle. You may also qualify for more than one adaptive-equipment grant to modify a vehicle with power steering, brakes, seats, windows, or lift equipment to assist you with getting into and out of the vehicle.

### How it works

In the case of these allowances, you must gain VA approval before purchasing an automobile or adaptive equipment. For the adaptive-equipment grant, the compensation may be paid to you or to the seller. For the one-time vehicle purchase grant, the compensation must be paid directly to the seller. You may request and receive either grant before or after military discharge.

You must show that your disability is service connected or is treated as if service connected under [38 U.S.C. 1151](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/title-38-USC-1151/).

You will need to complete [VA Form 21-4502](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-4502-ARE.pdf) (Application for Automobile or Other Conveyance and Adaptive Equipment).

If you are entitled to adaptive equipment only (for example, you have a service-connected disability due to ankylosis of the knees or hips), you should complete [VA Form 10-1394](http://www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/10-1394-fill.pdf) (Application for Adaptive Equipmentâ€”Motor Vehicle).
