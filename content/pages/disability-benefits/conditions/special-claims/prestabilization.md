A prestabilization rating is a temporary rating for recently separated Veterans with an unstable disability and an immediate need for services and support. Prestabilization ratings may be granted at 50% or 100%, depending on the severity of the disability, and continue for one year after discharge from active service.

**Example**
While in active service, a Servicemember was diagnosed with Hodgkinâ€™s disease and began chemotherapy that continued during and after her medical discharge process. She coordinated through her local VA medical center for follow-on treatment. Her claim for compensation resulted in a prestabilization rating of 100% for one year from her date of discharge.
