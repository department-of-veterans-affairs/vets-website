<div class="va-introtext">

If you recently ended your active military service and you have a disability related to your service (called a service-connected disability), you may be able to get temporary disability compensation or benefits right away.

If you qualify for these benefits, you'll get what's called a prestabilization rating. This rating may be 50% or 100%, depending on the severity of your disability. Your prestabilization rating will continue for 1 year after your discharge from active service.

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

- Health care
- Compensation (payments)

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits. When you apply, you'll have to show that you have a severe, service-connected disability that's unstable and expected to continue for an unknown amount of time. This information will normally be part of your Service Treatment Record. [Apply for benefits](/disability-benefits/apply/).

**Example:** While in active service, a Servicemember was diagnosed with Hodgkinâ€™s disease and began chemotherapy that continued during and after her medical discharge process. She continued to get treatment through her local VA medical center, and we gave her a prestabilization rating of 100% for 1 year from her date of discharge.
