### How it works

When filing your claim, you should submit evidence that the additional disability occurred as a result of VA medical care, or from participation in VA vocational rehabilitation or compensated work-therapy programs. The additional disability cannot be a reasonably expected result of or complication from treatment.

Compensation payments are awarded in the same manner as if the disability is service connected.
