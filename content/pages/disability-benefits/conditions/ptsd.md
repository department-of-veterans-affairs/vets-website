#### Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Basics

Posttraumatic stress can happen after someone goes through a traumatic event such as combat, an assault, or a disaster. Most people have some stress reactions following trauma. But if the reactions don’t go away over time or they disrupt your life, you may have PTSD. [Learn more about PTSD](http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/index.asp).

You may be able to get disability compensation or benefits if you have symptoms of PTSD and while serving in the military you: 
- Suffered a serious injury, personal or sexual trauma, or sexual violation, **or** 
- Were threatened with injury, sexual assault, or death

You’ll need to apply for benefits. [Apply for disability benefits](/disability-benefits/apply/).

Please note that the screening process for disability benefits is geared toward getting a full understanding of your PTSD, not treating it. To get help or treatment, contact your health care provider or any of the emergency contacts listed at the top of this page.
