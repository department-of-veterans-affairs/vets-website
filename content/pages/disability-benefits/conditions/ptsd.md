#### Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Basics

Posttraumatic stress can happen after someone goes through a traumatic event such as combat, an assault, or a disaster. Most people have some stress reactions following trauma. But if the reactions don’t go away over time or they disrupt your life, you may have PTSD. <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/index.asp"><span class="usa-sr-only">This will open a new website.</span>Learn more about PTSD</a>.

You may be able to get disability compensation or benefits if you have symptoms of PTSD and while serving in the military you: 
- Suffered a serious injury, personal or sexual trauma, or sexual violation, **or** 
- Were threatened with injury, sexual assault, or death
