<div class="va-introtext">

Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a type of cancer of the lymph glands and other lymphatic tissue—a part of your body’s immune system that helps to fight infection and illness. We believe that non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma can be caused by contact with Agent Orange, a toxic chemical used to clear trees and plants during the Vietnam War. If you had contact with Agent Orange while serving in the military—and now have non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma—you can get disability compensation or benefits.

##### Signs of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma include:

- Swollen, painless lymph nodes in your neck, armpit, or groin
- Fever
- Night sweats
- Fatigue (feeling very tired)
- Weight loss
- Pain or swelling in your abdomen (the area that includes your stomach)
- Chest pain or trouble breathing
- Itchy skin

You may be able to get disability benefits if you have non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and both of these are true:

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits. We consider non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma to be related to contact with Agent Orange. So, when you apply for benefits, you won't have to show that your illness is related to Agent Orange or that it began during—or got worse because of—your military service.
