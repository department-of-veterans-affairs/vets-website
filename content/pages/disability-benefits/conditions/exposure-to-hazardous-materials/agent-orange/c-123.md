<div class="va-introtext">

If you flew on—or worked with—C-123 aircraft in Vietnam or other locations, you may have had contact with Agent Orange. The U.S. military used this toxic chemical to clear trees and plants during the Vietnam War. C-123 aircraft sprayed Agent Orange during the war, and the planes still had traces of the chemical in them afterward while they were being used, up until 1986. Find out if you can get disability compensation or benefits for illnesses believed to be caused by contact with Agent Orange.

### Can I get disability benefits from VA?

#### For Active-Duty Servicemembers

You may be able to get disability benefits if you have an illness believed to be caused by contact with Agent Orange and both of these are true:

- You served in a regular Air Force unit location where a C-123 aircraft with traces of Agent Orange was assigned, **and**
- Your flight, ground, or medical duties put you in regular and repeated contact with C-123 aircraft that had traces of Agent Orange
