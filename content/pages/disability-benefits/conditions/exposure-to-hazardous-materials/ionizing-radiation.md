Yes, if:

You were exposed to ionizing radiation during military service in one of the following ways:

  - As a participant in atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, or
  - As a participant in the postwar occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, or
  - As a prisoner of war in Japan, or
  - While working in a military occupation such as an x-ray technician, performing work in a reactor plant, nuclear medicine, or radiography (Note: Your exposure to ionizing radiation must have occurred while serving on active duty or as a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces during a period of active or inactive duty for training), or
  - While performing tasks similar to those performed by a Department of Energy (DOE) employee qualifying them as a member of the Special Exposure Cohort. [See 42 U.S.C. 7384L(14)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7384l)

### How it works

VA requests from the appropriate military service or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency an estimate of your level or range of radiation exposure. The military service or agency reports to VA the range within which a Veteran may have been exposed, and VA accepts the highest level of the dose range. See [38 CFR 3.311(b)(5)](http://www.warms.vba.va.gov/regs/38CFR/BOOKB/PART3/S3_311.DOC) for more information.
