If you served at—or were assigned to—Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune or Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River in North Carolina, you may have had contact with contaminants (toxic chemicals) in the drinking water there. We believe that contact with these contaminants during your military service caused certain illnesses. This is known as a presumptive service connection. Find out if you can get disability compensation or benefits for certain illnesses with a presumptive service connection.
