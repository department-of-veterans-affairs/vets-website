If you served at—or were assigned to—Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune or Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River in North Carolina, you may have had contact with contaminants (toxic chemicals) in the drinking water there. Scientists believe that contact with these contaminants during military service caused certain illnesses. This is known as a **presumptive service connection.** If you or a family member has an illness with a presumptive service connection, find out if you can get disability compensation or benefits.
