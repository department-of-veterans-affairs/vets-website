### Can I get disability benefits from VA?
You may be able to get disability benefits if you have a current illness or injury (known as a condition) that affects your body or mind and:
-	We believe your time spent as a POW caused your condition, **and**
-	At any time following active-duty service, your condition became at least 10% disabling. We use a disability rating system to measure the severity of your disability.


### What conditions do these benefits cover?

These benefits cover conditions that we believe were caused by time spent as a POW (called presumptive disabilities). We've decided to cover these conditions because of studies that have been done on the long-term effects of captivity, deprivation, trauma, and cold injury.

#### For former POWs held captive for any length of time

**Conditions that affect your body, including:**
-	Osteoporosis (for claims filed on or after October 10, 2008, and you have a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD)
-	Lasting damage from frostbite
-	Posttraumatic osteoarthritis (pain and swelling in your joints that happens when a past injury causes a joint—such as your knee or elbow—to wear out)
-	A stroke or problems caused by a stroke (such as memory loss, loss of speech, or weakness in an arm or leg)
-	Hypertensive vascular disease, including hypertensive heart disease, and related problems (such as a stroke, blood clots, or other serious issues)

**Conditions that affect your mind, including:**
-	A neuropsychiatric condition 
-	Psychosis 
-	Dysthymic disorder
-	Any of the anxiety states (such as PTSD)

#### For former POWs held captive for 30 days or more

**Conditions that affect your body, including:**
-	Osteoporosis (for claims filed on or after September 28, 2009; no PTSD diagnosis required)
-	Helminthiasis 
-	Peripheral neuropathy, except where directly related to an illness caused by an infection
-	Peptic ulcer disease 
-	Chronic dysentery 
-	Irritable bowel syndrome 
-	Cirrhosis of the liver 

**Any nutritional deficiency, including:**
