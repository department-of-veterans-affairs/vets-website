<li class="step one">

<div markdown="1">

##### Prepare

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

###### Documents you’ll need

For the first compensation claim you send VA, please provide:

- Discharge papers (DD214 or equivalent)
- Service treatment records

Both of these documents can be ordered through the [National Archives]( https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/).

For all compensation claims, please provide:

- VA medical records and hospital reports that relate to your claimed conditions
- Private medical records and hospital reports that relate to your claimed conditions

</div>

</li>

<li class="step two">

<div markdown="1">

##### Apply

Choose one of three ways:

- Apply online, using [eBenefits]( https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=disability-compensation), or
- Work with an [accredited representative](/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/help/index.html), or
- Go to a [VA regional office](http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/offices.asp) and have a VA employee assist you.

**Note:** Servicemembers should learn about [predischarge claims](/disability-benefits/claims-process/claim-types/predischarge-claim/).

</div>

</li>

<li class="step three">

<div markdown="1">

##### VA Review

###### How long will it take for VA to review my claim?
The amount of time it takes to review your claim depends on:

- The type of claim you filed
- How many injuries or disabilities you claimed and how complex they are
- How long it takes us to collect the evidence needed to decide your claim


</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

###### What happens after I file my claim?

<ol class="">
<li>

**Claim Received**

You'll see a notice from us in your claims list within about 1 hour if you applied online with VONAPP Direct Connect. If you applied through the U.S. mail, you’ll need to allow for mailing time plus 1 week before you get a note telling you we have your claim.


</li>

<li>

**Initial Review**

A Veterans Service Representative (VSR) will review your claim. It will move to step 3 if we don’t need any more evidence to support it.


</li>

<li>

**Evidence Gathering, Review, and Decision**

During this step, the VSR will do 3 things:
- Ask for evidence from you, health care providers, governmental agencies, or others
- Review the evidence
- Make a decision

If we need more evidence during the review, your claim may return to this step more than once. 


</li>

<li>

**Preparation for Notification**

We'll get your entire claim decision packet ready to be mailed.


</li>

<li>

**Claim Complete**

We'll send you a packet by U.S. mail that includes details of the decision on your claim. Please allow 7 to 10 business days for your packet to arrive before contacting a VA call center.

</div>

<div markdown="1">

###### What if VA needs more information?

- We may reach out on your behalf to other governmental agencies (like the Department of Defense) for records.
- If we need more medical information, we may ask you for it. We may also schedule a VA claim exam (also known as a C&P exam) to get more information about the disabilities you claimed.

**Note:**  We may schedule you for 1 or more exams based on the number and type of disabilities claimed.

###### Do I need to do anything while I’m waiting?

Not unless you hear from us. You don't need to do anything else unless we send you a letter asking for more information. If we schedule any exams for you, be sure not to miss them.
