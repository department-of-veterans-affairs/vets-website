##### VA Review

###### The amount of time it takes to process your claim depends on several factors:

- The type of claim you filed, such as compensation, claim for increased evaluation, etc.
- How many injuries or disabilities you claimed and how complicated they are.
- How long it takes  for VA to gather the evidence needed to decide your claim.

</div>


<div class="feature" markdown="1">

###### Here’s what happens once you’ve filed your claim:

1. VA receives your claim. **(Claim Received)**
2. A Veterans Service Representative (VSR) examines your claim to determine if VA needs any additional information to make a decision. **(Under Review)**
3. If VA needs additional information, the VSR requests it from you or asks for it on your behalf. **(Gathering of Evidence)**
4. Once VA obtains, or has completed its efforts to obtain, all the information it needs, the VSR ensures each issue claimed is ready for a decision.
**(Review of Evidence)**
5. The VSR electronically routes the claim and supporting information to a Rating Veterans Service Representative (RVSR) for a final decision. **(Preparation for a Decision)**

</div>

<div markdown="1">

###### What if VA needs more information?

- VA may reach out on your behalf to other governmental agencies, such as the Department of Defense, for records.
- If VA needs more medical information, it may ask you to provide it. VA may also schedule an examination for you to assess the disabilities you claimed.

**Note:**  VA may schedule you for one or more examinations based on the number and type of disabilities claimed, such as joint, lung, or mental conditions.

###### Do I need to do anything while I’m waiting?

Other than attend scheduled examinations, you don't need to do anything else unless VA sends you a letter saying it needs more information.

</div>

<div markdown="1">

##### Decision

- The RVSR decides your claim after reviewing all evidence in your record, including the initial application, examination reports, and service treatment records.
- After deciding the claim, the RVSR routes it to a VSR to input the decision and draft the decision letter. A Senior Veterans Service Representative (SVSR) reviews the completed documents, then authorizes release of the letter and any payment.

If you disagree with the decision, you may appeal it. The decision letter contains appeal information. [File an appeal](/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/).
