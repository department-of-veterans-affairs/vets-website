<div class="va-introtext">

For each disability claim, we assign a severity rating from 0% to 100% in 10% increments (for example, 10%, 20%, 30%). We base this rating on the evidence—supporting documents like a doctor’s report or medical test results—you give us as well as other information we may get from other sources like federal agencies. [File a claim now](/disability-benefits/apply/).

See the Combined Ratings page to learn how we calculate disability percentage for more than 1 disability. [See Combined Ratings](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/rates-index.asp#combined).
