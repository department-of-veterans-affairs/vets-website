<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">Can I get disability benefits from VA?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You may be able to get disability benefits if you have a current illness or injury (known as a condition) that affects your body or mind and you meet at least one of the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true:**

- You got sick or injured while serving in the military—and can link this condition to your illness or injury, **or**
- You had an illness or injury before you joined the military—and serving made it worse

<h4>Presumed disabilities</h4>
If you have a disability that's been diagnosed by a doctor and that we consider to be related to your military service because of a specific aspect of that service, you may be able to get disability benefits based on this presumed disability. This usually applies to:
- [A chronic (long-lasting) illness that appears within 1 year after discharge](/disability-benefits/eligibility/one-year/), **or**
- [An illness caused by contact with contaminants (toxic chemicals) or other hazardous materials](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/)
