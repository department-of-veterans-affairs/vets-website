<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">Can I get disability benefits from VA?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You may be able to get disability benefits if you have a current illness or injury (known as a condition) that affects your body or mind and you meet at least one of the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true. You:**
- Got sick or injured while serving in the military—and can link this condition to your illness or injury (called an inservice disability claim), **or**
- Had an illness or injury before you joined the military—and serving made it worse (called a preservice disability claim), **or**
- Have a disability related to your active-duty service that didn’t appear until after you ended your service (called a postservice disability claim)

<h4>Presumed disabilities</h4>
If you have a disability that's been diagnosed by a doctor and that we consider to be related to your military service because of a specific aspect of that service, you may be able to get disability benefits based on this presumed disability. This usually applies to:
- [A chronic (long-lasting) illness that appears within 1 year after discharge](/disability-benefits/eligibility/one-year/), **or**
- [An illness caused by contact with contaminants (toxic chemicals) or other hazardous materials](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/)

<h4>Who's covered?</h4>
- Veterans
- Qualified dependents
