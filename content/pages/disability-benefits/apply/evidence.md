<div class="va-introtext">

When you file a disability claim, we review all available evidence (supporting documents) to determine if you qualify for benefits. Find out what evidence we'll need—and what your options are for gathering documents to support your claim.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### What evidence will VA look for to support my claim?

We'll look for evidence of:

- A current physical or mental disability (damage to your body or mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work)
- An event, injury, or illness that happened while you were serving in the military to cause the disability

### What documents will I need when I file my claim?

We require certain documents to support all claims for disability benefits. You'll need to provide or give us permission to gather:

-	Your DD214 or other separation documents
-	Service treatment records
-	Medical evidence related to your illness or injury (like doctor's reports, X-rays, and medical test results)
</div>

### Your options for gathering evidence: <br>
### Standard vs. fully developed claims

When you file your claim, you have 2 options for gathering evidence. You can choose to file:

- A standard claim (where we take more responsibility for gathering related records from both federal and nonfederal sources that you identity and authorize), **or**
- A fully developed claim (where you send in all evidence you have—or can easily get—when you file your claim)

Filing a fully developed claim may speed up the claim process and help you get your decision sooner.

**For certain types of claims, you may be eligible to file through our Decision Ready Claims program.** Through this program, you may be able to get a decision on your claim within 30 days or less by working with an accredited Veterans Service Organization (VSO).<br>

#### Standard claims
With standard claims, we take more responsibility for gathering related records from both federal and nonfederal sources that you identify and authorize, so we can decide your claim.

##### What you’re responsible for
You'll need to let us know about related records not held by a federal agency, and give us any information we may need in order to get them. These may include records from:
  -	State or local governments
  -	Private (non-VA) doctors and hospitals
  -	Current or former employers

We'll also need your permission to gather other evidence—even if its evidence you may have or can easily get yourself. This may include:
- Privately held evidence and information that you tell us about (such as records from a private doctor or hospital), **and**
- Records from state or local governments or current or former employers

##### What we’re responsible for
We'll get related records from:
  -	Any federal agency (including the military)
  -	VA medical centers (including private facilities where VA has authorized treatment)
  -	The Social Security Administration

We'll also provide a medical exam for you, or we'll get a doctor’s opinion, if we need it to make a decision on your claim.

**Example**<br>
A Veteran filed a disability claim that included prior treatment from a private doctor and a prior Social Security disability award. In this case, we were responsible for getting the Social Security records. We also helped to get the private doctor’s records, but the Veteran was responsible for making sure we got those.

<br>

<span id="claim-fullydeveloped">

#### Fully developed claims
You can use the Fully Developed Claims (FDC) program to get a faster decision on your disability benefits claim.

With this program, you send in all the evidence (supporting documents) you have—or can easily get—when you file your claim. This may include:
- Records of medical treatment you've received for the claimed illness or injury (also known as a condition) while serving in the military
-	Military personnel records that relate to the claimed condition
-	Private medical records related to the claimed condition, like reports from your own doctor or X-rays or other test results from a non-VA hospital or other treatment center

We consider your disability benefits claims to be fully developed when:
- You've sent us all related evidence, **and**
- We plan to get your federal records, if needed, **and**
- We plan to arrange for any added health exams or doctors' opinions that we may need

If we discover that there are other private records we need to decide your claim, we’ll remove your claim from the FDC program and review it through the standard claims process.
