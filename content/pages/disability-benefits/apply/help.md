If you need help filing a claim, you may want to work with an accredited Veterans Service Officer, claims agent, or attorney. We trust these professionals because they’re trained and certified in the claims process and can help you with VA-related needs. Veterans Service Officers may work for Veterans Service Organizations (both are called VSOs), as well as for local government offices. Veterans Service Organizations advocate on behalf of Veterans and Servicemembers—as well as their dependents and survivors. Find out more about accredited representatives and how they can help you.

<h3 itemprop="name">What does it take to be an accredited representative or VSO?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

Accredited representatives and VSOs need to:
  - Pass an exam
  - Pass a background check
  - Take continuing-education courses to make sure they’re providing the most up-to-date information

Recognized organizations and individuals can legally represent a Veteran, Servicemember, dependent, or survivor before VA. Non-recognized organizations and individuals can provide information, but can’t be representatives.

<h4 itemprop="name">What does it cost to use an accredited representative or VSO?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

In general, no individual or organization may charge you a fee to help you file your initial application for benefits. But they may charge you for unusual expenses. It is only after VA has made a decision about your claim that VA-accredited claims agents and attorneys may charge for their services. Make sure you ask up front what, if any, fees you’ll be charged. If you believe a claims agent or attorney charged a fee that’s too high, you can challenge it. <br>
