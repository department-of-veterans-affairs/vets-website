If you need help filing a claim or appeal, you may want to work with an accredited attorney, a claims agent, or a Veterans Service Officer (VSO). We trust these professionals because they’re trained and certified in the VA claims and appeals processes and can help you with VA-related needs.

VSOs work on behalf of Veterans and Servicemembers—as well as their dependents and survivors. Find out more about accredited representatives and how they can help you.

<h3 itemprop="name">What does it take to be an accredited representative or a VSO?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

Accredited representatives and VSOs need to:
  - Pass an exam
  - Pass a background check
  - Take continuing-education courses to make sure they’re providing the most up-to-date information

Recognized organizations and individuals can legally represent a Veteran, Servicemember, dependent, or survivor before VA. Non-recognized organizations and individuals can provide information, but can’t be representatives.

<h3 itemprop="name">What does an accredited representative or a VSO do?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">


Accredited representatives and VSOs can help you understand and apply for VA benefits, like:

- Financial support (monthly payments)
- Education
- Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR&E)
- Home loans
- Life insurance
- Pension
- Health care
- Burial benefits

These trained professionals can also:
- Help you gather supporting documents (like a doctor’s report or medical test results)
- File a claim or appeal on your behalf
- Provide added support, like helping with transportation to medical appointments or emergency funds

**Note:** Veterans Service Officers work for Veterans Service Organizations (both are called VSOs), as well as for local government offices.

<h4 itemprop="name">What does it cost to use an accredited representative or a VSO?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

In general, no individual or organization may charge you a fee to help you file your initial application for benefits. But they may charge you for unusual expenses. It's only after we've made a decision about your original claim that VA-accredited claims agents and attorneys may charge for their services. Make sure you ask up front what, if any, fees you’ll be charged. If you believe a claims agent or attorney charged a fee that’s too high, you can challenge it. <br>
