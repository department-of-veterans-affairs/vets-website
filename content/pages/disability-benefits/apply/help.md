If you need help filing a disability claim, you may want to work with an accredited representative. We trust these professionals because they’re trained in the claims process and can help you with VA-related needs.

Most accredited representatives work for Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs). These private nonprofit groups advocate on behalf of Veterans and Servicemembers as well as their dependents and survivors.

<h3 itemprop="name">What does it take to be an accredited representative?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

Accredited representatives need to:
  - Pass an exam
  - Pass a background check
  - Take continuing-education courses to make sure they’re providing the most up-to-date information

Recognized organizations and individuals can legally represent a Veteran, Servicemember, dependent, or survivor before VA. Non-recognized organizations and individuals can provide information, but can’t be representatives.

Accredited representatives help you understand and apply for VA benefits, like:

- Financial support (monthly payments)
- Education
- Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR&E)
- Home loans
- Life insurance
- Pension
- Health care
- Burial benefits

Accredited representatives can also help you gather supporting documents (like a doctor’s report or medical test results) and can file a claim on your behalf.

<h4 itemprop="name">What does it cost to use an accredited representative?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

Many VSOs provide their services free of charge, but they may ask you to pay them back for unusual expenses. However, VA-accredited claims agents and attorneys may charge for their services. Make sure you ask up front what, if any, fees you’ll be charged. If you believe you were charged a fee that’s too high by a claims agent or attorney, you can challenge it. [Find out more in the “How to Challenge a Fee” guide](https://www.va.gov/OGC/docs/Accred/HowtoChallengeaFee.pdf).
