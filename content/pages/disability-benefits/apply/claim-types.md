<div class="va-introtext">

Find out when you can first file a claim for service-connected benefits—and what to do if you want to request more benefits or have new evidence to support a claim we denied in the past.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="claim-active-duty">Original claim—File your first claim for disability benefits.</button>
<div id="claim-active-duty" class="usa-accordion-content">

We refer to the first claim you file for a disability as your original claim.

**You can file a claim up to 180 days before leaving the service:**

- **If you have 90-180 days left on active duty**, you may be able to file a predischarge claim through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. This may help speed up the claim decision process so you can get your benefits sooner.<br>
[Find out how to file a predischarge claim](/disability-benefits/apply/claim-types/predischarge-claim/).

- **If you have less than 90 days left on active duty**, you can't file your claim through the BDD program. But you can still file before you're discharged, and your claim will be processed after separation as a fully developed or standard claim.<br>
[Learn more about gathering evidence for standard and fully developed claims](/disability-benefits/apply/evidence/).

**You can also file a claim for a disability that appears after discharge:**

This is called a postservice claim. There's no time limit on filing a postservice claim. But you should know that the process may become more complex the longer you wait.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="claim-special">Special Claim—File a claim for special needs linked to your service-connected disability.</button>
<div id="claim-special" class="usa-accordion-content">

You can file a special claim to request compensation for special needs. 

**These may include needs like:**
- A specially equipped vehicle if your service-connected disability prevents you from driving, **or**
- Temporary payments if you're recovering from surgery or other treatment and unable to move, **or**
- Increased payments if you can't work because of your service-connected disability

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="claim-new-evidence">Reopened Claim—Provide new evidence to support a disability claim that was denied in the past.</button>
<div id="claim-new-evidence" class="usa-accordion-content">

You can file a reopened claim if you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true:**
- We denied your claim at least 1 or more years ago, **and**
- You didn’t file an appeal at that time, **and**
- You have new and material evidence (new supporting documents like a doctor’s report or medical test results) that we haven’t seen before and that's directly related to your claim

For example, you might file a reopened claim if you were treated for pain in your elbow while on active duty, but were denied disability benefits because your VA health exam didn't find a problem, and then 2 year's later you get an X-ray of your elbow that shows signs of arthritis (a painful swelling and sometimes wearing down of a joint). In this case, you would need to send your new exam and X-results to us as new evidence related to the claim.<br>

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="claim-more-benefits">New Claim—File a claim for added benefits or other benefit requests related to an existing service-connected disability.</button>
<div id="claim-more-benefits" class="usa-accordion-content">

**You can file a new claim to request:**
- More financial support
- Special monthly payments
- A shift to Individual Unemployability status (a status given to Veterans who are unable to work because of a disability).<br>
[Learn more about Individual Unemployability](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/individual-unemployability/).

Our decision on your new claim will be based only on new evidence (like a doctor's report or medical test results) that you give us to support your claim. We won't consider any evidence you may have given us related to past claims.

<div id="claim-secondary" class="usa-accordion-content">

You can file a secondary claim to get more disability benefits for a new disability that's linked to a service-connected disability you already have.

**For example, you might file a secondary claim if you:**
- Develop arthritis that's caused by a service-connected knee injury you got while on active duty, **or**
- Develop heart disease that's caused by caused by the high blood pressure you were diagnosed with while on active duty and that we'd previously concluded was connected to your service
