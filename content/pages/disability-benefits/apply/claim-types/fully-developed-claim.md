<div class="va-introtext">

You can use the Fully Developed Claims (FDC) program to get a faster decision on your disability benefits claim. With this program, you send in all the evidence (supporting documents) you have—or can easily get—when you file your claim. 

</div>

This may include:
- Records of medical treatment you've received for the claimed illness or injury (also known as a condition) while serving in the military
- Military personnel records that relate to the claimed condition
- Private medical records related to the claimed condition, like reports from your own doctor or X-rays or other test results from a non-VA hospital or other treatment center

We consider your disability benefits claim fully developed when:
- You've sent us all evidence, **and**
- We plan to get your federal records, if needed, **and**
- We plan to arrange for any added health exams or doctor's opinions that may be needed
