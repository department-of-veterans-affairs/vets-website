### Can I have my VA disability exam completed at an Overseas Intake Site?

To have your VA disability exam completed at an Overseas Intake Site, you must:
 
- File your claim 90 to 180 days before your known discharge date, **and**
- Have a copy of your service treatment records for your most recent period of service, **and**
- Be available for the exam up (which may take place up to 45 days from the date you apply), **and**
- Have enough time in-country to complete the medical exam process (which may involve multiple specialty clinics)

</div>

### How do I file a BDD claim?

#### Within the Kaiserslautern Military Community (KMC)

If you're stationed within the KMC, visit the Landstuhl BDD office, where you can start your disability claim while you’re on active duty in predischarge status. Walk-in hours are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., and from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.

#### Outside the KMC

If you're stationed outside the KMC, use the BDD program through the “Fly-in” claim process. This process lets you apply by fax or email before your in-person appointment. Here’s what you need to do to use the Fly-in claim process:

<ol class="process">
  <li class="process-step list-one">Contact the Landstuhl BDD office by phone, fax, or email to ask for all needed information and forms.</li>
  <li class="process-step list-two">- Fill out and return your application as directed.</li>
  <li class="process-step list-three">Look for an email from a BDD officer. The officer will contact you to schedule an exam at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) and to let you know about the information and evidence (supporting documents like doctor’s reports and medical test results) needed to support your claim.</li>
  <li class="process-step list-four">Contact the clinics at LRMC to schedule your exams as directed.</li>
  <li class="process-step list-five">Arrange your travel, and get your command’s approval to make the trip.</li>
  <li class="process-step list-six">Bring a copy of your Service Treatment Records (STRs) when you report for your exams. These won’t be returned. A BDD claim can’t be processed without these records.</li>

</ol>
