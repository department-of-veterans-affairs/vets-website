You can file a disability claim through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program while you’re stationed overseas. You'll need to make sure you have enough time to finish your medical exam in the country where you're located, which may include visits to specialty clinics.

### In Europe, Africa, or the Middle East
If you're stationed outside the Kaiserslautern Military Community, you can file a pre-discharge claim through the BDD's “Fly-in” claim process. You can apply by fax or email before your in-person appointment. Follow these steps to use the Fly-in claim process:

<ol class="process">
  <li class="process-step list-one">

  **Contact the Landstuhl BDD office to ask what information and forms you need.** You can contact the office by:
  - **Phone** at DSN 590-8200 (or commercial 06371-9464-8200), **or**
  - **Email** at <a href="mailto:GermanyBDD.vbapit@va.gov">GermanyBDD.vbapit@va.gov</a>

  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-two">

  **Fill out and return your application as directed.**

  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-three">

  **Look for an email from a BDD officer.** The officer will contact you to schedule an exam at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) and to let you know what information and evidence (supporting documents like doctor’s reports and medical test results) you'll need to support your claim.

  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-four">

  **Contact the clinics at LRMC to schedule your exams.**

  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-five">

  **Arrange your travel, and get your command’s approval to make the trip.** Be sure to schedule enough time to complete the medical exam in the country where you're located.

  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-six">

  **Bring a copy of your service treatment records when you report for your exams.** It's very important to remember these records because we can't process your BDD claim without them. The copy you turn in won't be returned.

  </li>
