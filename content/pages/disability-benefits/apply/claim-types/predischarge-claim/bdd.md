### How do I get these disability benefits? 

You'll need to apply for benefits. When you apply, you'll have to turn in your service treatment records. You'll also need to finish all phases of the VA/DOD medical separation examination processes before your release from the military. [Apply for benefits](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/apply/).

**Exception:** If you're less than 60 days from separation, you can file a different kind of claim called a Quick Start claim. [Learn more about Quick Start claims](/disability-benefits/apply/claim-types/predischarge-claim/quick-start/index.html).
