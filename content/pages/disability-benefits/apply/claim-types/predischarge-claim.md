<div class="va-introtext">

If you have a service-connected disability and you’re currently in pre-discharge status, you can file a claim for disability benefits 180 to 90 days before you leave the military. This may help speed up the claim decision process so you can get your benefits sooner. Find out how to file a claim through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program, depending on where you're stationed.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I use the BDD program to get my disability benefits sooner?
You can use the BDD program if:
-	You’re a Servicemember on full-time active duty (including a member of the National Guard, Reserve, or Coast Guard), **and**
- You have a known separation date, **and**
-	Your separation date is within the next 180 to 90 days

<br>

### What if I have less than 90 days left on active duty?
You can't file a BDD claim or add more medical conditions to your initial claim. But you can still file your claim prior to discharge, and it'll be processed after separation as a fully developed or standard claim.</br>
[Learn about the application process](/disability-benefits/apply/).</br>
[Learn about the evidence needed for fully developed and standard claims](/disability-benefits/apply/evidence/).

<br>

### Is there any other reason I wouldn't be able to use the BDD program?
Yes. Even if you file your claim in time, you can't use the BDD program if your claim requires special handling because you:
- Need case management for a serious or very serious injury or illness, **or**
- Have suffered the loss of a body part, **or**
- Are terminally ill, **or**
- Are awaiting discharge from a VA hospital or military treatment facility, **or**
- Need to have a VA exam done in a foreign country (except if the exam can be requested by the overseas BDD office in either Landstuhl, Germany or Yongsan, Korea), **or**
- Are pregnant, **or**
- Require a Character of Discharge determination, **or**
- Can't go to a VA exam during the 45 days after you submit your claim **or**
- Don't have a copy of your treatment records for your current period of service **or**
- Added a medical condition to your claim but have fewer than 90 days left on active duty (we will process those conditions after you separate from the military)


</div>

### What kinds of disability benefits can I get?
Compensation (monthly payments)

  **Look for an email from a BDD officer.** The officer will contact you to schedule an exam at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) and to let you know what information and evidence (supporting documents like doctor’s reports and medical test results) you'll need to support your claim.

  </li>

  <li class="process-step list-four">
