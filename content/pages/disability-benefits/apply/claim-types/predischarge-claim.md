<div class="va-introtext">

If you have a service-connected disability and you’re currently in predischarge status, you can file a claim for disability benefits 90 to 180 days before you leave the military. This may help speed up the claim decision process so you can get your benefits sooner. Find out how to file a claim through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program, depending on where you're stationed.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I use the BDD program to get my disability benefits sooner?
You can use the BDD program if:
-	You’re a Servicemember on full-time active duty (including a member of the National Guard, Reserve, or Coast Guard), **and**
- You have a known separation date, **and**
-	Your separation date is within the next 90 to 180 days 

**Please note:** If you have less than 90 days left on active duty, you can't file a BDD claim or add more health problems to your initial claim. But you can still file your claim prior to discharge, and it'll be processed after separation as a fully developed or standard claim.</br>

[Learn more about fully developed and standard claims](/disability-benefits/apply/evidence/).

<br>

### Is there any reason I won't be able to use the BDD program, even if I file my claim in time?
Yes. You can't use the BDD program if your claim requires special handling because you:
- Need case management for a serious or very serious injury or illness, **or**
- Have suffered the loss of a body part, **or**
- Are terminally ill, **or**
- Are awaiting discharge from a VA hospital or military treatment facility, **or**
- Need to have a VA exam done in a foreign country (except if the exam can be requested by the overseas BDD office in Landstuhl, Germany or Yongsan, Korea), **or**
- Are pregnant, **or**
- Require a Character of Discharge determination

In these cases, your claim may be covered by another program, like the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) for Servicemembers being medically separated.

</div>

### What kinds of disability benefits can I get?
Compensation (monthly payments)

<br>

### What if I develop a health problem while serving that makes me unable to perform my duties?
You'll be referred to the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES). Through this system, we at VA work together with the Department of Defense (DoD) to make disability evaluation seamless, simple, fast, and fair.

If you're found to be medically unfit for duty, IDES will give you a proposed VA disability rating before you leave the service. And you may be entitled to Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) services. [Find out if you may be eligible for VR&E](TBD).
