<div class="va-introtext">

If you have a disability and you’re currently in predischarge status, you can file a claim for disability benefits up to 180 days before any of these changes to your status:

</div>

- Separation from active duty
- Retirement from active duty
- Release from full-time Reserve duty
- Release from National Guard duty

Filing your claim as you get ready to leave the military may speed up the claim decision process. Processing times tend to be faster for claims submitted before separation than for those submitted after separation.
