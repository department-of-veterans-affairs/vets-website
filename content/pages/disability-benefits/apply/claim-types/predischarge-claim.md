<div class="va-introtext">

If you have an illness or injury that you believe was caused—or made worse—by your active-duty service, you can file a claim for disability benefits 180 to 90 days before you leave the military. This may help speed up the claim decision process so you can get your benefits sooner. Find out how to file a claim through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program, and what to do if you have less than 90 days left on active duty.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I use the BDD program to get my disability benefits sooner?
You can use the BDD program if:
-	You’re a Servicemember on full-time active duty (including a member of the National Guard, Reserve, or Coast Guard), **and**
- You have a known separation date, **and**
-	Your separation date is in the next 180 to 90 days

<br>

### What if I have less than 90 days left on active duty?
You can't file a BDD claim or add more medical conditions to your initial claim. But you can still begin the process of filing your claim before discharge. You have 2 options for filing:

- **Go through The Decision Ready Claim (DRC) program.** This is the fastest way to get your claim processed. You'll work with an accredited Veterans Service Organization (VSO) to file your claim. A VSO is a private nonprofit group that serves as an advocate for Veterans and Servicemembers as well as their dependents and survivotrs. With your VSO's help, you can get a decision within 30 days. <br/>
[Learn more about the DRC program](#drc-program) <br/>
[Learn more about VSOs and how to find one](/disability-benefits/apply/help/)<br/>

- **File a fully developed or standard claim.** The difference in these claim types is based on how you gather evidence (supporting documents like a doctor's report and medical test results) to support your claim.<br/>

<br>

### Are there any other reasons I wouldn't be able to use the BDD program?
Yes. Even if you file your claim in time, you can't use the BDD program if your claim requires special handling because you:
- Need case management for a serious injury or illness, **or**
- Have suffered the loss of a body part, **or**
- Are terminally ill, **or**
- Are waiting to be discharged while being treated at a VA hospital or other military treatment facility, **or**
- Need to have a VA exam done in a foreign country (except if the exam can be requested by the overseas BDD office in either Landstuhl, Germany, or Yongsan, Korea), **or**
- Are pregnant, **or**
- Are waiting for us to determine your Character of Discharge, **or**
- Can't go to a VA exam during the 45 day period after you submit your claim, **or**
- Didn't submit copies of your treatment records for your current period of service, **or**
- Added a medical condition to your original claim when you had less than 90 days left on active duty (**Note:** We'll process the added conditions after your discharge.)

### What's the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES), and how does it work?

If you’re wounded, injured, or fall ill while serving and can’t perform your duties, you’ll be referred IDES. Through this system, we at VA work together with the Department of Defense (DoD) to make disability evaluation seamless, simple, fast, and fair.

If you’re found to be medically unfit for duty, IDES will give you a proposed VA disability rating before you leave the service. You'll also be entitled to Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) services. <br/>
[Find out how to access VR&E services through IDES](/employment/vocational-rehab-and-employment/ides/).
