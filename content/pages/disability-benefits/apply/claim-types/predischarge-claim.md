<div class="va-introtext">

If you have a disability and you’re currently in predischarge status, you can file a claim for disability benefits 90 to 180 days before you leave the military. Filing your claim as you get ready to leave the military may speed up the claim decision process. Processing times tend to be faster for claims submitted before separation than for those submitted after separation. Find out how to file a claim through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program, depending on where you're stationed.

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I use the BDD program to get my disability benefits sooner?

You can use the BDD program if:

-	You’re a Servicemember on full-time active duty (including a member of the National Guard, Reserve, or Coast Guard), **and**
- You have a known separation date, **and**
-	Your separation date is within the next 90 to 180 days

### Are there any situations that might mean I can't use the BDD program?

Yes. There are certain situations that mean you won't be able to use this program because your claim will require special handling. You **cannot** use the BDD program if you:

- Need case management for a serious or very serious injury or illness
- Have suffered loss of a body part and are considered a "special category person" (SPC)
- Are terminally ill
- Are awaiting discharge from a VA hospital or military treatment facility
- Need to have a VA exam done in a foreign country (except if the exam can be required by the overseas BDD office in Landstuhl, Germany or Yongsan, Korea)
- Are pregnant
- Require a Character of Discharge determination

**Please note:** If you have less than 90 left on active duty, you can't file a BDD claim or add additional medical conditions to your initial claim. But you can still file your claim prior to discharge under the Fully Developed Claim program, the standard VA claims process, or any other qualifying VA claims process.

### What kinds of disability benefits can I get?

Compensation (monthly payments)

### What if I develop a health problem while serving that makes me unable to perform my duties?

You'll be referred to the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES). Through this system, we at VA work together with the Department of Defense (DoD) to make disability evaluation seamless, simple, fast, and fair.

If you're found to be medically unfit for duty, IDES will give you a proposed VA disability rating before you leave the service. And you may be entitled to Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) services. [Find out if you may be eligible for VR&E](TBD).

<spand id="stationed-emea">
  
#### If you're stationed overseas in Europe, African, or the Middle East

If you're stationed outside the Kaiserslautern Military Community (KMC), use the BDD program through the “Fly-in” claim process. This process lets you apply by fax or email before your in-person appointment. Follow these steps to use the Fly-in claim process:

<ol class="process">
  <li class="process-step list-one">Contact the Landstuhl BDD office by phone, fax, or email to ask for all needed information and forms.</li>
  <li class="process-step list-two"> Fill out and return your application as directed.</li>
  <li class="process-step list-three">Look for an email from a BDD officer. The officer will contact you to schedule an exam at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) and to let you know about the information and evidence (supporting documents like doctor’s reports and medical test results) needed to support your claim.</li>
  <li class="process-step list-four">Contact the clinics at LRMC to schedule your exams as directed.</li>
  <li class="process-step list-five">Arrange your travel, and get your command’s approval to make the trip. Be sure to schedule enough time to complete the medical exam process.</li>
  <li class="process-step list-six">Bring a copy of your Service Treatment Records (STRs) when you report for your exams. These won’t be returned. A BDD claim can’t be processed without these records.</li>

</ol>
