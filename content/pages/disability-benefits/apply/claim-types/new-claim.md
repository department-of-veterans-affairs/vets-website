<div class="va-introtext">

If you're already getting disability benefits but think you may qualify for more, you can file a new claim. [File a claim now](/disability-benefits/apply/).

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

When you file a new claim, you may get:
- More financial support 
- Special monthly payments
- A shift to Individual Unemployability status (a status given to Veterans who are unable to work because of a disability). [Learn more about Individual Unemployability](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/individual-unemployability/).
