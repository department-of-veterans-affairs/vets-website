<h3>Appeals Process Overview</h3>
<p>
After the Veterans Benefits Administration makes a decision on your claim, you can appeal some or all of the decision if you disagree with it. If you want to, you can have a representative help you with your appeal. This person may be a lawyer, claims agent, or Veterans Service Officer. <a href="/disability-benefits/apply/help/">Get help filing your appeal</a>.

<h4>An appeal follows these steps</h4>

<ul class="vertical-list-group more-bottom-cushion">
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <div>
      <h4>File a Notice of Disagreement (NOD)</h4>
      <p>
      By filing a Notice of Disagreement, you begin the appeals process. You’ll need to file a Notice of Disagreement within 1 year of the date on the letter notifying you of the claim decision. <a href="https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0958-ARE.pdf">Download a Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 21-0958)</a>. Fill out your Notice of Disagreement and mail it to the address provided on the VA claim decision notice letter you received, or bring it to your local regional office. A representative can help you file a Notice of Disagreement. <a href="/disability-benefits/apply/help/index.html">Get help filing your appeal</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>The Veterans Benefits Administration sends you Statement of the Case</h4>
    <p>
      After you file your Notice of Disagreement, a Decision Review Officer will review all of the evidence related to your appeal, including any new evidence you sent. If the Decision Review Officer determines that there is not enough evidence to fully grant your appeal, they will send you their findings in a document called a Statement of the Case. You can then decide whether to continue your appeal to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>You return the VA Form 9</h4>
    <p>
      When you receive a copy of the Statement of the Case in the mail, you’ll also get a VA Form 9. If you disagree with the Statement of the Case and want to continue your appeal to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals, you must return VA Form 9 within 60 days.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>The Veterans Benefits Administration prepare a new Statement of the Case (optional visual treatment)</h4>
    <p>
      You can submit new evidence for your appeal at any time in the process. If you submit new evidence after you receive a Statement of the Case, the Decision Review Officer will need to write a new Statement of the Case before transferring your case to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. Once your appeal is transferred, new evidence can be sent directly to the Board and will not be reviewed by the Veterans Benefits Administration.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>Your appeal is sent to the Board</h4>
    <p>
    The Decision Review Officer will finish their review and transfer your case to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. The Board reviews cases in the order they are received as determined by the date of the VA Form 9. A judge will begin work on your appeal when it is among the oldest appeals that are ready for their review.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you are suffering a serious illness or are in financial distress, or for other sufficient cause, you can apply to have your appeal Advanced on Docket. If you are older than 75, your appeal will receive this status automatically. Advanced on Docket appeals are prioritized so that they are always at the front of the line. <a href="/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/request-a-priority-review/">Learn how to request Advanced on Docket status</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>You have a hearing (optional visual treatment)</h4>
    <p>
      You have the option to request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge. At your hearing, the judge will ask you questions about your appeal. A transcript of your hearing will be made and added to your appeal file. The judge will not make a decision about your appeal at the hearing. <a href="/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/hearings/">Learn more about hearings at the Board</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>The Board makes its decision</h4>
    <p>
      The Board reviews your appeal and provides a decision on each issue in your appeal. The Board decides each issue in 1 of 3 ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Allowed:</strong> The Board grants benefits.</li>
      <li><strong>Remanded:</strong> The Board needs more evidence to make a decision and will return your appeal to VBA. After VBA obtains the additional evidence, it will then make a new decision on the appeal. If VBA can’t grant all or part of your appeal, it will prepare a new SSOC and return the appeal to the Board.</li>
      <li><strong>Denied:</strong> The Board does not grant benefits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> About 60% of all decisions have at least 1 issue remanded.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

        No. At this time, all forms, evidence, and other paperwork for your appeal have to be sent through the mail. You’ll find the correct mailing address on information sent to you by VA, or you can send it to:<br/>

      <div id="dbq3" class="usa-accordion-content">
        <p>Yes. The appeals process has a “continuous open record.” This means you can send in new evidence and/or make new arguments at any point from the beginning to the end of the appeals process. We also follow what’s known as a duty to assist policy. This means that we’ll help you get your treatment records you’ve identified and we’ll provide a physical exam if one is needed.</p>
        <p>Each time you present new arguments and add or find new evidence, VBA will make a decision or prepare a new Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC). This can add time to your appeal, but may make your appeal more successful if the evidence supports your argument.</p>
