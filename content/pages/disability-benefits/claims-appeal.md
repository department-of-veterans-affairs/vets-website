You have the right to appeal any benefits decision made by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). The VA appeals process is set in law and is different from other judicial appeals processes. Find out how to file an appeal.

### Have you already filed an appeal?

When the VBA Regional Office (RO) receives your Notice of Disagreement (NOD), you’ll be able to check the status of your appeal on Vets.gov.

<h3>Appeals Process Overview</h3>
<p>
After VBA has made a decision on your claim, if you disagree with the outcome, you can file an appeal for some or all of the issues you were seeking benefits for in your claim.
</p>
<p><strong>The process has many steps that can repeat themselves.</strong> At any time in the process, VA can issue a decision on part or all of your appeal, but in general an appeal follows these steps:</p>

<ul class="vertical-list-group more-bottom-cushion">
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <div>
      <h4>File a Notice of Disagreement (NOD)</h4>
      <p>
        By filing an NOD, you begin the appeals process. You’ll need to file an NOD within 1 year from the date on the letter letting you know of the decision on your claim. <a href="https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0958-ARE.pdf">Download a Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 21-0958)</a>
      </p>
      <p>Fill out your NOD and mail it to the address provided on the VA claim decision notice letter you received, or bring it to your local RO.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>RO prepares the Statement of the Case (SOC)</h4>
    <p>
      After you file your NOD, if the RO can’t grant all or part of your appeal, it will prepare the SOC for the issues in your appeal that were not granted. To do this, they review all the evidence related to your appeal, including any new evidence you submit. You’ll receive a copy of it in the mail.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>Submit a Form 9</h4>
    <p>
      When you receive a copy of the SOC in the mail, you’ll also receive a Form 9. If you disagree with the SOC and want to continue the appeal process, you must return Form 9 within 60 days. This step is also called filing a Substantive Appeal.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>(Optional) RO prepares the Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC)</h4>
    <p>
      You can submit new evidence for your appeal at any time in the process. Each time you do, the RO will need to make a decision or prepare an SSOC if the RO can’t grant all or part of your appeal. This may add time to your appeal, but may make your appeal more successful if the evidence supports your argument. This step can happen at any time after the RO prepares the SOC.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>RO certifies your appeal to the Board</h4>
    <p>
      The RO will prepare your appeal and send it to the Board for review. Your appeal will wait in line until the Board is able to review it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>The Board activates your appeal</h4>
    <p>
      The Board now has control of your appeal. Lawyers who are experts in Veterans law and reviewing benefit claims will review it. The review prepares your appeal for a Veterans Law Judge who will make a decision. In most cases, your appeal is reviewed in the order it was received. In some cases, an appeal will be moved to the front of the line—this happens if you’re facing severe financial hardship, over age 75, or have a serious illness.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>(Optional) Hearing</h4>
    <p>
      If you request a Board hearing, you’ll be sent a letter at least 30 days before it’s scheduled to happen. <a href="/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/hearings/">Learn more about hearings</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <h4>The Board makes its decision</h4>
    <p>
      The Board has reviewed your appeal and provides a decision on each issue in your appeal. Each issue will be decided in 1 of 3 ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Allowed:</strong> The Board grants benefits.</li>
      <li><strong>Remanded:</strong> The Board needs more evidence to make a decision and will return your appeal to VBA. After VBA obtains the additional evidence, it will then make a new decision on the appeal. If VBA can’t grant all or part of your appeal, it will prepare a new SSOC and return the appeal to the Board.</li>
      <li><strong>Denied:</strong> The Board does not grant benefits.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

      <div id="dbq3" class="usa-accordion-content">
        <p>Yes. The appeals process has a “continuous open record.” This means you can send in new evidence and/or make new arguments at any point from the beginning to the end of the appeals process. We also follow what’s known as a duty to assist policy. This means that we’ll help you get your treatment records you’ve identified and we’ll provide a physical exam if one is needed.</p>
        <p>Each time you present new arguments and add or find new evidence, VBA will make a decision or prepare a new Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC). This can add time to your appeal, but may make your appeal more successful if the evidence supports your argument.</p>
