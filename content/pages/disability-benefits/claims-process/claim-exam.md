After you [file your disability benefits claim](/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/), we may ask you to undergo a claim exam to help us [rate your disability](/disability-benefits/claims-process/ratings/). The VA claim exam is also known as a compensation and pension (C&P) exam.

We will call you to schedule the exam using the phone number you entered in [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage). If we can't reach you by phone, we'll send you an appointment letter by U.S. mail.

If you have enough medical evidence in your file to support your claim, we won't ask you to undergo a claim exam.

 ### What happens at a VA claim exam

The length of your exam depends on the conditions you've claimed. For example, the required questions the doctor asks about a documented knee injury may take only a few minutes, while the questions for a more complex injury could take much longer. The doctor or technician will:
-	Address only the service-connected conditions you've claimed and any related conditions
-	Ask you a series of questions taken from the [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)](http://benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_ListByDBQFormName.asp) for each condition
-	Ask you to get other tests, such as X-rays or blood work, if needed

If you have new non-VA medical records that you haven't given us yet, like records for a recent surgery, bring them to the exam.

### Common questions

#### Is a claim exam like a normal doctor's appointment?
No. The purpose of the exam is to gather information specific to your claim, not to treat or diagnose your condition(s).

#### Who will examine me?
The examiner may be a VA doctor or a private-sector doctor who has been contracted by us to do the exam. You can also have your own doctor [examine you and fill out the necessary forms](http://benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_veteraninstruct.asp).  

#### Will I get my exam results at the VA claim exam?

No. The doctor will give the exam results to VA claims processors, who will make a decision about your claim based on this evidence along with your other medical and military records.

#### What happens after the exam?

We will review all the evidence in your file, assign your rating, and send you a decision notice (a letter with your disability rating) about two weeks after the exam. If you would like a copy of the final report from your claim exam, go to [MyHealtheVet](https://www.myhealth.va.gov) or call VA at 800-827-1000.  

#### What information will the VA claims processor have?

This person can see the medical records you have given us, statements from you and others about your claim, and your military medical and personnel records. 

#### What will happen if I don't go to my VA claim exam?

VA may make a decision about your disability benefit based on the evidence it already has—which may not be enough. However, missing your exam won't affect your compensation or rating if you didn't go because you had “good cause," for example:
- An illness or hospitalization
- Serious illness or injury of someone in your immediate family
- Bad weather
- A previously planned and paid-for event, such as a vacation

If you miss your claim exam, you’ll need to let us know why you didn’t make it.

#### Is there any other reason I would need to undergo a claim exam?

If you [appeal your disability benefits decision](/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/), we may ask you to come in for a claim exam.

### Keep in touch

It’s important to keep your contact information up to date in [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage) so we can let you know when to come in for your appointment.
