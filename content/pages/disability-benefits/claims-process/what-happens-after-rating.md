If you've received a decision notice with your disability rating, you may be eligible for compensation, education, health care, housing, employment, and dependent benefits.  

If you haven’t received your decision notice, check your status on [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=va-letters) or contact your [regional VA office](/facility-locator/).


#### Look for a payment within 15 days  
If you’ve received a notice with at least a 10% disability rating, you will get either a direct-deposit payment or a check within 15 days of your decision notice. If you don’t get a payment, please call the Veterans Help Line at 800-827-1000.  

#### If you disagree with your disability rating, you may appeal
You may [file an appeal](/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/) within one year of receiving a decision notice.

#### Apply for benefits

- If you served on active duty, and separated under conditions other than dishonorable, you may qualify for [VA health care](https://www.vets.gov/healthcare/apply/).
- If you are in good health other than your service-connected disabilities, you can buy Service-Disabled Veterans’ Insurance (S-DVI), a government life-insurance policy. [Apply for S-DVI](/life-insurance/S-DVI) or call 1-800-669-8477.
- You can get VA education benefits or additional education benefits under special programs. Learn about [education benefits](/education) or speak to a VA education counselor to find out what benefits are available to you.   
- If you are 30% or more service-connected disabled, you can receive additional payments and benefits for your dependents. Register using [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=dependent-compensation) or by contacting your local [eligibility office](/facility-locator/).
- Check with your [local or state Veterans Affairs offices](http://www.va.gov/statedva.htm) for other possible benefits.  


#### Apply for benefits that cover specific disabilities

- If you have a 100% disability rating, you may qualify for [dental care](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/dentistry/) and [commissary and exchange privileges](http://www.militaryonesource.mil/shopping?content_id=268500).
- If you can’t work due to your service-connected disability, even without a 100% rating, you can apply for [Individual Unemployability](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/individual-unemployability/).
- If you require modified clothing because of your injuries, VA offers a [clothing allowance](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/clothing/) to eligible Veterans.


#### Keep in touch
It's important to update your information with VA when you have a new address, a change to your marital status, or any other life change that could affect your rating or payment. If your condition becomes worse, you may file a claim for an increase in benefits. Update your information through [eBenefits]( https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=dependent-compensation) or by contacting your [local VA office or eligibility office](/facility-locator/).
