Disability compensation may include financial compensation (payments) as well as other benefits—like health care or job training.

If you haven’t gotten your decision notice:

- [Check your status](/disability-benefits/track-claims/), **or**
- [Contact your local regional benefit office](http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/offices.asp), **or**
- Call us at <span class="tel">800-827-1000</span>, **or**
- [Contact us online](https://iris.custhelp.com/app/ask/session/L3RpbWUvMTQ4MTgwOTI0My9zaWQvbnNTbnViNm4%3D) 
</div>

#### Look for a payment within 15 days  
If you’ve received a notice with at least a 10% disability rating, you will get either a direct-deposit payment or a check within 15 days of your decision notice. If you don’t get a payment, please call the Veterans Help Line at <span class="tel">800-827-1000</span>.

#### If you disagree with your disability rating, you may appeal
You may [file an appeal](/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/) within 1 year of receiving a decision notice.

#### Apply for benefits

- If you served on active duty, and separated under conditions other than dishonorable, you may qualify for [VA health care](https://www.vets.gov/healthcare/apply/).
- If you are in good health other than your service-connected disabilities, you can buy Service-Disabled Veterans’ Insurance (S-DVI), a government life-insurance policy. Apply for S-DVI or call 1-800-669-8477.
- You can get VA education benefits or additional education benefits under special programs. Learn about [education benefits](/education) or speak to a VA education counselor to find out what benefits are available to you.   
- If you are 30% or more service-connected disabled, you can receive additional payments and benefits for your dependents. Register using [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=dependent-compensation) or by contacting your local [eligibility office](/facilities/).
- Check with your [local or state Veterans Affairs offices](http://www.va.gov/statedva.htm) for other possible benefits.  


#### Apply for benefits that cover specific disabilities

- If you have a 100% disability rating, you may qualify for [dental care](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/dentistry/) and [commissary and exchange privileges](http://www.militaryonesource.mil/shopping?content_id=268500).
- If you can’t work due to your service-connected disability, even without a 100% rating, you can apply for [Individual Unemployability](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/individual-unemployability/).
- If you require modified clothing because of your injuries, VA offers a [clothing allowance](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/clothing/) to eligible Veterans.


#### Keep in touch
It's important to update your information with VA when you have a new address, a change to your marital status, or any other life change that could affect your rating or payment. If your condition becomes worse, you may file a claim for an increase in benefits. Update your information through [eBenefits]( https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=dependent-compensation) or by contacting your [local VA office or eligibility office](/facilities/).
