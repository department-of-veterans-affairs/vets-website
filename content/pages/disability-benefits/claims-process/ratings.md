title: How VA Assigns Disability Ratings
template: 1-topic-landing
---

The amount of compensation depends on the severity of your disability. VA determines this based on the evidence you provide, as well as the information VA obtains about your disability.

VA rates disability from 0% to 100% in 10% increments (for example, 10%, 20%, 30%). See the [Combined Ratings page](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/rates-index.asp#combined) for information about how VA calculates disability percentage for multiple disabilities.

### You may be paid additional amounts, in certain instances, if:

-	You have very severe disabilities or loss of limb(s).
-	You have a spouse, child(ren), or dependent parent(s).
-	You have a seriously disabled spouse.
