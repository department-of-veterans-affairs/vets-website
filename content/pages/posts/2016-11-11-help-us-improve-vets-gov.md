#### A Message from Secretary Robert McDonald

I’m excited to tell you about the new features and services we’ve launched on vets.gov! Vets.gov enables Veterans to discover, apply for, track, and manage the benefits they’ve earned. It’s still a work in progress, but it’s a huge step forward in bringing Veterans the online services they need and deserve.

<!--more-->


These are just some of the features we’ve launched this past year:

- **Online Health Care Application** – Enables Veterans to determine eligibility and apply for VA health care more quickly and easily from any device.
- **GI Bill School Caution Flags** – Enables VA to post caution flags in real time about schools that are under investigation.
- **Online Application for Education Benefits** – Enables Veterans to apply for VA education benefits more quickly and easily from any device.
- **Veterans Crisis Line (VCL)** – Gives Veterans one-click access to call and text the VCL from any device.
- **Facility and Service Locator** – Enables Veterans to search for certain services at VA facilities; additional services will be added over the coming months.

Vets.gov will be the single Veteran-facing website where Veterans will go to “do something.” We take a mobile-first design approach, so everything works well on mobile devices. We are also rewriting all the content using plain language before we add it to vets.gov. This straightforward approach to language makes it easier to find what you need quickly without having to interpret jargon or wade through unnecessary words.

Veterans have been speaking and we’ve been listening. We’ve talked to more than 200 Veterans this year, and their feedback drives our new design and features on vets.gov. Our website is being “built in the open,” meaning we build a portion of the site or a feature based on our Veteran research, and then we show it to Veterans to get their feedback on how we can improve it. Our approach to building vets.gov is one of constant refinement and improvement. Your feedback will guide and shape everything we do. This website isn’t about us—it’s about you. So please contact us at [feedback@va.gov](mailto:feedback@va.gov) to take part in our user research. It’s fast and easy, and your opinion will drive vets.gov features and functionality!

With thanks and excitement,

Secretary Robert McDonald
