<h3>Schedule an appointment</h3>

<h4 itemprop="name">By phone</h4>

<div itemprop="itemListElement">

You can call the VA health facility where you want to receive care. This is usually the quickest way to make all your VA appointments. If you can’t keep an existing appointment, please contact the facility as soon as possible to reschedule or cancel. [Find your VA health facility’s phone number](/facilities).
</div>

<h4 itemprop="name">Online</h4>

<div itemprop="itemListElement">

VA now offers online appointment scheduling for some appointments. We hope to expand the number of VA facilities and types of appointments in the future.

If you have VA health care benefits, you can schedule your VA primary care appointments online if you:

- Are scheduling your appointment with a [VA medical facility that accepts online scheduling](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/keeping-up-with-all-your-va-appointments#facility-list), **and**
- Have had an appointment at that VA medical facility within the last 2 years, **and**
- Have a [My HealtheVet Premium account](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/upgrading-your-my-healthevet-account-through-in-person-or-online-authentication) or [DS Logon Premium account](https://mobile.va.gov/dslogon) (used for eBenefits and milConnect)

With your online status, you'll also be able to:

- Track the status of requests
- Send messages about requested appointments
- Get notifications about appointments
- Cancel appointments
