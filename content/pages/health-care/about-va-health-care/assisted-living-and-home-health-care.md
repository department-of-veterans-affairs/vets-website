### What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer for sick or disabled Veterans?

Our long-term care services include:

- 24/7 nursing and medical care
- Physical therapy
- Help with daily tasks (like bathing, dressing, making meals, and taking medicine)
- Comfort care and help with managing pain
- Support for caregivers who may need skilled help or a break so they can work, travel, or run errands

You can get this care in many different settings—some run by VA and others run by state or community organizations that we inspect and approve, including:

- Nursing homes
- Assisted-living centers
- Private homes where a caregiver supports a small group of individuals
- Adult day health centers
- Veterans’ own homes

You can learn more about the different types of care below or on our va.gov website. [See our guide to long-term services and supports](https://www.va.gov/GERIATRICS/Guide/LongTermCare/index.asp).

### How do I access these services?

You may be able to use one or more of these services if:

- You’re signed up for VA health care, **and**
- We conclude that you need a specific service to help with your ongoing treatment and personal care, **and**
- The service (or space in the care setting) is available near you

We may also consider other factors, like your service-connected disability status or insurance coverage.

To find out how to access these services, contact your VA social worker. Or, call our toll-free hotline at 877-222-VETS (<a href="tel:+1-877-222-8387">877-222-8387</a>), Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. (ET).

### Does VA pay for these services?

We cover some of these services under your standard health benefits if you’re signed up for VA health care. You may still need to pay a copay for some covered services. [Apply for VA health care](/health-care/apply/).

Other services aren’t covered under VA health care benefits. For these services, you may be able to pay through Medicaid, Medicare, or your own private insurance.
