A Veteran ID Card (VIC) is a form of photo ID you can use to get discounts offered to Veterans at many restaurants, hotels, stores, and other businesses. With this card, you won’t need to carry around your DD214 or other military discharge papers (like your DD256, DD257, or NGB22) or share sensitive personal information to receive these discounts. Find out if you’re eligible for a Veteran ID Card—and how to apply.

#### A note on verifying your identity	

When you sign in to Vets.gov, we need to verify your identity to make sure you’re you—and not someone pretending to be you—before we can give you access to your personal information. This helps to keep your information safe and prevent fraud and identity theft. 

We do this using ID.me—our trusted technology partner that provides the strongest identity verification system available. ID.me is 1 of 4 Single Sign-On providers that meet the U.S. government’s most rigorous requirements for online identity proofing and authentication.

If you already have a premium DS Logon account, you can sign in with your DS Logon information and we’ll connect your account to Vets.gov through ID.me. If you don’t have an account on Vets.gov, you can create one using ID.me.<br>
