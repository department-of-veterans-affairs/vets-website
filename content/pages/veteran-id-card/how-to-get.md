A Veteran ID Card is a form of photo ID you can use to get discounts offered to Veterans at many restaurants, hotels, stores, and other businesses. With this card, you won’t need to carry around your DD214 or share sensitive personal information to receive these discounts. Find out if you’re eligible for a Veteran ID Card—and how to apply.

### Can I get a Veteran ID Card?

**You may be eligible for a Veteran ID Card if you:**
- Served on active duty, **and**
- Separated under honorable conditions

**Note:** If you have a less than honorable discharge, you can apply for an upgrade or correction. If your application goes through and your discharge is upgraded, you’ll be eligible for the Veteran ID Card and other VA benefits you earned during your period of service. <br>

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="replace">Will my Veteran ID Card replace my other military ID cards?</button>
<div id="replace" class="usa-accordion-content">

No. Your Veteran ID Card won’t replace your Veteran Health Identification Card, Common Access Card, or Department of Defense Uniformed Services or retiree ID Card.

You can’t use your Veteran ID Card to prove your eligibility for any federal benefits or to access military installations.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="instead">Are there any other forms of ID I can use instead of a Veteran ID Card to get these discounts?</button>
<div id="instead" class="usa-accordion-content">

Yes.

**You can use any of these forms of ID to get the same discounts:**
- A Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC), **or**
- A Department of Defense (DoD) Identification Card—either a Common Access Card (CAC) or Uniformed Services ID Card, **or**
- A state-issued ID (driver’s license) with a Veteran designation or a state-issued Veteran ID Card. All 50 states and the District of Columbia offer one of these options.

If you already have one of these, you don’t need a Veteran ID Card, but you can still apply for it if you’d like.
