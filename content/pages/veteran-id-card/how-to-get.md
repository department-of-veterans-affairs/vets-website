A Veteran ID Card (VIC) is a form of photo ID you can use to get discounts offered to Veterans at many restaurants, hotels, stores, and other businesses. With this card, you won’t need to carry around your military discharge papers or share sensitive personal information to receive these discounts. Find out if you’re eligible for a Veteran ID Card—and how to apply.

### Can I get a Veteran ID Card?

**You may be eligible for a Veteran ID Card if you:**

* Served on active duty, in the military reserves, or in the National Guard, **and**
* Separated under honorable conditions

</div>

### How do I get a Veteran ID Card?

You’ll need to apply online.

**When you apply, be sure to have these on hand:**

* Your Social Security number
* A digital copy of your DD214, DD256, DD257, or NGB22 that you can upload. This could be a .pdf or other photo file format, like a .jpeg or .png
* A digital color photo of yourself<br>
  <br>
  **The photo has to follow all the standards listed here. It must:**
  * Show a full front view of your face and neck (with no hat, head covering, or headphones covering or casting shadows on your hairline or face), **and**
  * Be cropped from your shoulders up (much like a passport photo), **and**
  * Show you with your eyes open and a neutral expression, **and**
  * Be taken in clothing you'd wear for a driver's license photo, **and**
  * Be a square size and have a white or plain-color background (with no scenery or other people in the photo), **and**
  * Show what you look like now (a photo taken sometime in the last 10 years), **and**
  * Be uploaded as a .jpeg, .png, .bmp, or .tiff file

### Do I need to sign in to Vets.gov to apply for a Veteran ID Card?

No. You can complete the application without signing in, but it’ll take us longer to verify your identity. This will delay a decision on your application. The fastest way to get your application processed is to sign in with a My HealtheVet or DS Logon account (the same one you use for eBenefits or MilConnect) or an ID.me account.

**When you sign in to Vets.gov and verify your identity, you’ll:**

* **Get your card sooner** because we can confirm your Veteran status more quickly
* **Save time** because we may be able to prefill your application for you
* **Be able to save your in-progress application** and come back later to finish filling it out

### When will I hear back about my application?

It depends. We process applications in the order we receive them. If your application for a Veteran ID Card went through and you haven’t heard back yet, please don’t apply again.

#### A note on verifying your identity

When you sign in to Vets.gov, we need to verify your identity to make sure you’re you—and not someone pretending to be you—before we can give you access to your personal information. This helps to keep your information safe and prevent fraud and identity theft.

You can sign in with your My HealtheVet or DS Logon account, and we’ll connect your account to Vets.gov through ID.me. If you have a basic or advanced (non-premium) account, you’ll need to verify your identity through ID.me. We can also help you use ID.me to add an extra layer of security to your account. If you don’t have an account on Vets.gov, you can create one using ID.me.

ID.me is our trusted technology partner that provides the strongest identity verification system available. ID.me is 1 of 4 Single Sign-On providers that meet the U.S. government’s most rigorous requirements for online identity proofing and authentication.<br>
