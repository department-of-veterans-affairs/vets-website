### Can I plan ahead?

Yes. You can plan ahead to make the process of applying for a burial in a VA national cemetery easier for your family members when you die. To do this, you’ll need to apply for a pre-need determination of eligibility. [Find out how to apply](/burials-and-memorials/pre-need/).

You’ll get a letter from us telling you if you can be buried in a VA national cemetery. Keep this letter in a safe place.

If you want to be buried at a state or tribal Veterans cemetery, check the site you want ahead of time, since some state Veterans cemeteries require that you live in that state or have other rules around eligibility. [See a list of national and state VA cemeteries](http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/cems/listcem.asp).
