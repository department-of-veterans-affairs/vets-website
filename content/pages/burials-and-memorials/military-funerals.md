We carry out burial and memorial services at national cemeteries with dignity and respect. Find out what happens at a burial or memorial service. 

### What happens during the ceremony?

The ceremony, including any readings or military honors, takes place at a special area called a committal shelter (not at the gravesite). It lasts about 20 minutes. A cemetery official is there to show guests and family members where they should go. 

The family may choose to have military funeral honors. This may include the playing of “Taps,” a rifle detail, a color guard, or uniformed Servicemembers who present the burial flag. 

People attending the ceremony may:
- Bring flowers, which may go with the casket or urn when it’s taken from the committal shelter to the gravesite, **and**
- Visit the gravesite at the end of the workday, but not immediately following the ceremony

Funerals at Arlington National Cemetery are different. [Learn about Arlington National Cemetery funerals](http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Funerals/About-Funerals).
