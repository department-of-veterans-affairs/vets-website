### How do I plan a burial for a family member who has just died?

<br>

#### If you have a pre-need decision letter confirming they can be buried in a VA national cemetery:

To start, you may want to choose a funeral director to help you plan the burial. Then either you or the funeral director can call the National Cemetery Scheduling Office at <a href="tel:+18005351117">1-800-535-1117</a> to request a burial.

You don’t need to do anything else except prepare yourself and your family for the funeral. [Find out what to expect at a memorial service](/burials-and-memorials/what-to-expect-at-a-funeral/).

<br>

#### If you don't have a pre-need decision letter:

To start, you may want to choose a funeral director to help you plan the burial. Then either you or the funeral director will need to take these 3 steps to apply for a burial.

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

##### Gather the information and documents you'll need to identify the deceased

You'll need:

 - The DD214 or other discharge documents of the deceased or the Servicemember or Veteran whose military service will be used to decide if the deceased qualifies for burial in a VA national cemetery. If you can't find these documents, please ask for our help to get them. [Find out which discharge documents we accept along with your application](http://www.cem.va.gov/CEM/hmm/discharge_documents.asp).

You'll need the deceased's:

 - Name
 - Gender
 - Social Security number or Military Service number (Veteran ID)
 - Date of birth
 - Relationship to the Servicemember or Veteran whose military service will be used to decide eligibility
 - Marital status
 - Date of death (and zip code and county at the time of death)

You'll need information about the deceased's next-of-kin (the deceased's closest living relative), including the person's:

   - Name
   - Relationship to the deceased
   - Social Security number
   - Phone number
   - Address

You may also need more information in certain cases:

- **If the deceased was married**, you'll also need the surviving spouse’s status as Servicemember, Veteran or family member.
- **If the deceased has any children with disabilities**, you'll need the status and detailed information for any disabled children who may be buried in the future in a national cemetery.
- **If the deceased's spouse died previously and was buried in a VA national cemetery**, you'll need the full name of the predeceased spouse as well as the cemetery section and site number where they're buried.

##### Contact the National Cemetery Scheduling Office
