<div class="feature" markdown="0">

### Can I plan ahead for my burial?

Yes. You can plan ahead to make the process of applying for a burial in a VA national cemetery easier for your family members when you die. To do this:

Fill out the Application for Pre-Need Determination of Eligibility for Burial in a VA National Cemetery (VA Form 40-10007). [Download VA Form 40-10007](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA40-10007.pdf).

Send the application to the National Cemetery Scheduling Office in 1 of 3 ways:
- Email it to [eligibility.preneed@va.gov](mailto:eligibility.preneed@va.gov)
- Send it by U.S. mail to: 
  
<dl class="va-address-block">
    <dd>National Cemetery Scheduling Office</dd>
    <dd>P.O. Box 510543</dd>
    <dd>St. Louis, MO 63151</dd>
</dl>

  - Fax it to <span class="tel">855-840-8299</span>


You’ll get a letter from us telling you if you can be buried in a VA national cemetery. This is called your pre-need decision letter. Keep it in a safe place. Your family members will need this letter to request your burial after you've died.
