### Can I plan ahead for my burial?

Yes. You can plan ahead to make the process of applying for a burial in a VA national cemetery easier for your family members when you die. To do this:

**First, check to see if you qualify** for VA burial and memorial benefits. [Find out if you qualify](/burials-and-memorials/eligibility/). 

**Then, fill out the Application** for Pre-Need Determination of Eligibility for Burial in a VA National Cemetery (VA Form 40-10007). [Download VA Form 40-10007](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA40-10007.pdf). (To save your information in this form, make sure you have the latest free version of [Adobe Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/).)

**Send the application** to the National Cemetery Scheduling Office in 1 of 2 ways:

    St. Louis, MO 63151<br>
</p>
<br>

You’ll get a letter from us telling you if you can be buried in a VA national cemetery. This is called your pre-need decision letter. Keep it in a safe place. Your family members will need this letter to request your burial after you’ve died.
