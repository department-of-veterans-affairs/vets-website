<div class="va-introtext">

If you’re the survivor or parent of a Servicemember who died in the line of duty, or the survivor or parent of a Veteran who died from a service-related injury or illness, you may be able to get a tax-free monetary benefit called Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). Find out if you can get compensation. 

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="0">

### To get compensation, one of these must be true about the deceased Servicemember or Veteran:

- The Servicemember died while on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive-duty training.
- The Veteran died from a service-connected illness or injury.
- The Veteran didn’t die from a service-connected illness or injury, but was eligible to get VA compensation for a service-connected disability that VA rated as totally disabling: 
  - For at least 10 years before their death, **or**
  - Since the Veteran’s release from active duty and for at least 5 years immediately before their death, **or**
  - For at least 1 year before their death if the Veteran was a former Prisoner of War who died after September 30, 1999

**Note:** “Totally disabling” means the Veteran’s injuries make it impossible for them to work.
