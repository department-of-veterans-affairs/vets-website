- The Servicemember died while on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive-duty training.
- The Veteran died from a service-connected illness or injury.
- The Veteran didn’t die from a service-connected illness or injury, but was eligible to get VA compensation for a service-connected disability that VA rated as totally disabling: 
  - For at least 10 years before their death, **or**
  - Since the Veteran’s release from active duty and for at least 5 years immediately before their death, **or**
  - For at least 1 year before their death if the Veteran was a former Prisoner of War who died after September 30, 1999
