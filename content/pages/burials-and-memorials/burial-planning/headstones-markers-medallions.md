To honor the military service of a deceased Veteran, we may provide a headstone or marker to identify the burial place, or a medallion to attach to a headstone or marker. We provide these whether the Veteran is buried in a public or private cemetery. Family members may also qualify for a marker if they’re buried in a state Veterans cemetery, a national cemetery, or a cemetery at a military post or base. Find out how to arrange for one of these memorial items.

### Who can get a headstone, marker, or medallion?

- Any Veteran who died on or after November 1, 1990
- Any Veteran buried in an unmarked grave who served before September 7, 1980

### What information goes on the headstone or marker?

You must put a legal name, service branch, and birth and death year on a headstone or marker. State and national cemeteries also require the section and grave number. You can choose to inscribe the full birth and death dates, the highest rank attained, awards, war service, and an emblem of belief. We may approve other requests, such as nicknames, terms of endearment (for example, Loving Father), or special unit identification.

### Special Arrangements 

We provide memorial headstones and markers for qualified Veterans when remains are unavailable, not identified, donated to science, buried at sea, or scattered. 

For spouses who qualify for a headstone or marker, the first line on the headstone or marker must say, “In Memory of,” and it must be placed in a national cemetery, state Veteran's cemetery, or military base cemetery.
