To honor the military service of a deceased Veteran, we may provide a headstone, marker, or niche cover to identify the burial place in a federal, Department of Defense, or state Veterans cemetery. We may also provide a headstone, marker, or medallion (to attach to a privately purchased headstone or marker) for Veterans buried in private or public cemeteries. Family members may also qualify for a marker if they’re buried in a state Veterans cemetery, national cemetery, or cemetery at a military post or base. Find out how to arrange for one of these memorial items.

### What information goes on the headstone or marker?

You must put a legal name, service branch, and birth and death year on a headstone or marker. State and national cemeteries also require the section and grave number. You can choose to inscribe the deceased's full birth and death dates, the highest rank attained, awards, war service, and an emblem of belief. We may approve other requests, such as nicknames, terms of endearment (for example, "Loving Father"), or special unit identification.

### Special arrangements 

We provide memorial headstones and markers for qualified Veterans when their remains are missing, not identified, donated to science, buried at sea, or scattered. 

For Veterans, dependents, and Servicemembers who qualify for a memorial headstone or marker, the words engraved on the memorial item must begin, “IN MEMORY OF,” and the headstone or marker must be placed in a national cemetery, state Veterans cemetery, or military base cemetery.
