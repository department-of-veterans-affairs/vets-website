If you qualify for Veterans pension benefits, the amount you get will be based on the difference between your countable income and a limit that Congress sets (called the Maximum Annual Pension Rate, or MAPR). 

- **Your countable income** is how much you earn, including your salary, investment and retirement payments, and any income you may have from your dependents. Some expenses, like non-reimbursable medical expenses (medical expenses not covered by your insurance provider), may reduce your countable income.

- **Your MAPR amount** is the maximum amount of pension payable to a Veteran, surviving spouse, or child. Your MAPR is based on how many dependents you have, if you’re married to another Veteran, and if you qualify for Housebound or Aid and Attendance (A&A) benefits. MAPRs are adjusted each year for cost-of-living increases. You can find your current MAPR amount using the tables below.

**Example:**
You’re a qualified Veteran with a dependent, non-Veteran spouse and no children. You also qualify for A&A benefits. You and your spouse have a combined yearly income of $10,000.

Your MAPR amount = $25,525
Your yearly income = $10,000
Your VA pension = $15,525 for the year (or $1,293.75 paid each month)

**Find your Maximum Annual Pension Rate (MAPR) amount**
Date of Cost-of-Living Increase: 12-01-2016
Increase Factor:  .3%
Standard Medicare Deduction: Actual amount will be determined by SSA based on individual income.

**Note:** 
- **If you have more than 1 child,** add $2,205 to your MAPR amount for each additional child. 
- **If you have a child who works,** you may exclude their income up to $10,400 for 2017.
