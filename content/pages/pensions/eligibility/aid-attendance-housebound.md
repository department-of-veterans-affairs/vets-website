<div class="va-introtext">

If you need help with your daily activities, or you’re housebound, you may qualify for Aid and Attendance (A&A) or Housebound allowances in addition to your pension benefits. Find out if you can get these monthly payments added to the amount of your monthly pension.

**Can I get Aid and Attendance (A&A) or Housebound benefits from VA?**

You may qualify for **A&A** if you get a VA pension, **and** you:

- Need another person to help you perform daily activities, like bathing, feeding, and dressing, or
- Have to stay in bed—or spend a large portion of the day in bed—because of illness, or
- Are a patient in a nursing home due to the loss of mental or physical abilities related to a disability, or
- Your eyesight is limited (even with glasses or contact lenses you have only a 5/200 or less in both eyes; or concentric contraction of the visual field to 5 degrees or less)

You may qualify for **housebound benefits** if you get VA pension, **and** you spend most of your time in your home because of a permanent disability (a disability that doesn’t go away). 

**Note:** You can’t get A&A benefits and housebound benefits at the same time.

**Who’s covered:**
-	Qualified Veterans
-	Qualified surviving spouses 

</div>

**How do I get this benefit?** 

There are 2 ways you can get this benefit:

**Write to your Pension Management Center (PMC)**

You can write to the PMC for your state. [Find your PMC](pension/pension-management-centers/). 

Include this information: 
- Evidence, like a doctor’s report, that shows you need A&A or Housebound care, or have your doctor complete VA Form 21-2680, Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular and Attendance
- Details about what you normally do during the day and how you get places
- Details that help show what kind of illness, injury, or mental or physical disability affects your ability to do things, like take a bath, on your own 

**Or, apply in person**

You can bring your information to a Regional Benefits Office near you. [Find a Regional Benefits Office](/facilities/). 

**How long does it take VA to make a decision?**

Claims are processed in the order in which they are received unless priority processing is required.
