If you qualify for Veterans pension benefits, the amount you get will be based on the difference between your countable income and a limit that Congress sets (called the Maximum Annual Pension Rate, or MAPR). 

</div>

- **Your countable income** is how much you earn, including your Social Security benefits, investment and retirement payments, and any income your dependents receive. Some expenses, like non-reimbursable medical expenses (medical expenses not covered by your insurance provider), may reduce your countable income.

- **Your MAPR amount** is the maximum amount of pension payable. Your MAPR is based on how many dependents you have, if you’re married to another Veteran who qualifies for a pension, and if your disabilities qualify you for Housebound or Aid and Attendance (A&A) benefits. MAPRs are adjusted each year for cost-of-living increases. You can find your current MAPR amount using the tables below.

**Example:**
You’re a qualified Veteran with a dependent, non-Veteran spouse and no children. You also qualify for A&A benefits based on your disabilities. You and your spouse have a combined yearly income of $10,000.
<br>
Your MAPR amount = $25,525 <br>
Your yearly income = $10,000 <br>
Your VA pension = $15,525 for the year (or $1,293 paid each month)

### Find your Maximum Annual Pension Rate (MAPR) amount

*Date of Cost-of-Living Increase: December 1, 2016* <br>
*Increase Factor: .3%* <br>
*Standard Medicare Deduction: Actual amount will be determined by SSA based on individual income.*

**Note:** <br>
If you have medical expenses, you may deduct only the amount that’s above 5% of your MAPR amount ($645 for a Veteran with no spouse or child).
