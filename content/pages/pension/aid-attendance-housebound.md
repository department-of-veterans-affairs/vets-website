### Can I get A&A or Housebound benefits from VA?

**You may qualify for A&A** if you get a VA pension and:

- You need another person to help you perform daily activities, like bathing, feeding, and dressing, **or**
- You have to stay in bed—or spend a large portion of the day in bed—because of illness, **or**
- You are a patient in a nursing home due to the loss of mental or physical abilities related to a disability, **or**
- Your eyesight is limited (even with glasses or contact lenses you have only 5/200 or less in both eyes; or concentric contraction of the visual field to 5 degrees or less)

**You may qualify for housebound benefits** if you get a VA pension and you spend most of your time in your home because of a permanent disability (a disability that doesn’t go away). 

**Note:** You can’t get A&A benefits and housebound benefits at the same time.

#### Who’s covered:
- Qualified Veterans
- Qualified surviving spouses 

</div>

### How do I get this benefit?

There are 2 ways you can get this benefit:

#### Write to your Pension Management Center (PMC)

You can write to the PMC for your state. [Find your PMC](/pension/pension-management-center/). 

Include this information: 
- Evidence, like a doctor’s report, that shows you need A&A or Housebound care, or VA Form 21-2680  (Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance), which you can have your doctor complete 
- Details about what you normally do during the day and how you get places
- Details that help show what kind of illness, injury, or mental or physical disability affects your ability to do things, like take a bath, on your own 

#### Apply in person

You can bring your information to a Regional Benefits Office near you. [Find a Regional Benefits Office](/facilities/). 

### How long does it take VA to make a decision?

It depends. We process claims in the order we receive them, unless a claim requires priority processing.
