<div class="va-introtext">

The Fully Developed Claim (FDC) program is the fastest way to get your claim processed, and there’s no risk to your taking part in it. Just send in all your evidence, or supporting documents, when you file your claim. Participation in the FDC program is optional and won’t affect your benefits.

If you file a claim in the FDC program and we decide that additional documents exist that we need to decide your claim, we’ll remove your claim from the FDC program and process it as a standard claim.

Find out how you can participate in the FDC program.

#### Standard Claim Process

With a standard claim, you’ll give us permission to gather evidence or records for you. You’ll need to give us enough information about the evidence so we can request it from the right person or agency.

If a person or agency refuses to turn over the evidence, asks for money for the evidence, or can’t get the evidence, we’ll ask you to try to get the evidence or records. It’s your responsibility to make sure we receive all requested records that aren’t at a federal agency or office.
