<div class="va-introtext">

The Fully Developed Claim (FDC) program is the fastest way to get your claim processed, and there’s no risk to your taking part in it. Just send in all the evidence or supporting documents you have when you file your claim. Participation in the FDC program is optional and won’t affect your benefits.

If you file a claim in the FDC program and we decide that additional documents exist and are need to decide your claim, VA will remove your claim from the FDC program and process it as a Standard Claim.

#### FDC Program (Optional Faster Process)

When turning in your claim under the FDC program, you must send VA all the supporting documents you have and provide any information on relevant documents that you don’t have.
Submit your claim according to FDC Criteria:

1. File your claim by filling out and turning in an Application for Pension (VA Form 21-527EZ).
2. When you file your claim, turn in:
    - All necessary income and net-worth information, **and**
    - All private medical records you have that are related to your claim, **and**
    - Information about any health records that are available at a federal facility, like a VA medical center or clinic
3. Go to any VA medical appointments that are necessary to decide your claim

#### Standard Claim Process

With a standard claim, you’ll give VA permission to gather evidence or records for you. You’ll need to give VA enough information about the evidence so they can request it from the right person or agency.

If a person or agency refuses to turn over the evidence, asks for money for the evidence, or can’t get the evidence, VA will ask you to try to get the evidence or records. It’s your responsibility to make sure VA receives all requested records that aren’t at a federal agency or office.

    - 90 days of consecutive active service, with at least 1 day during wartime, **or**
    - 90 days of combined service, with at least 1 day during wartime
    (Note: If your service began after September 7, 1980, additional service requirements may apply, typically 2 years of continuous service or completion of active-duty service), **or**
    - Any length of active-duty service during wartime, with discharge because of a service-connected disability

2. You’re at least 65 years old or have a permanent and total disability. You’re considered permanently and totally disabled if medical evidence shows that you:

    - Are a patient in a nursing home for long-term care, **or**
    - Receive Social Security disability benefits, **or**
    - Are unemployable because of a disability that doesn’t go away, **or**
    - Have a disability that doesn’t go away and that makes it impossible for you to work, **or**
