<div class="va-introtext">

If you qualify for survivors pension benefits, the amount you get will be based on the difference between your countable income and a limit that Congress sets (called the Maximum Annual Pension Rate (MAPR). 

</div>

- **Your countable income** is how much you earn, including your salary, investment and retirement payments, and any income you may have from your dependents. Some expenses, like non-reimbursable medical expenses (paid medical expenses not covered by your insurance provider), may reduce your countable income.

- **Your MAPR amount** is the maximum amount of pension payable to a Veteran, surviving spouse, or child. Your MAPR is based on how many dependents you have and whether you qualify for Housebound or Aid and Attendance (A&A) benefits. MAPRs are adjusted each year for cost-of-living increases. You can find your current MAPR amount using the tables below.

**Example:**
You’re a qualified surviving spouse with 1 dependent child. You also qualify for A&A benefits. Your yearly income is $10,000.

* Your MAPR amount = $16,506
* Your yearly income = $10,000
* Your VA pension = $6,506 for the year (or $542.17 paid each month)

**Find your Maximum Annual Pension Rate (MAPR) amount**

* Date of Cost-of-Living Increase: December 1, 2016
* Increase Factor:  .3%
* Standard Medicare Deduction: Actual amount will be determined by SSA based on individual income.

**For qualified surviving spouses with at least 1 dependent:**

| **If you have 1 dependent child and…** | **Your MAPR amount is:** | 
| --- | --- | 
| You don’t qualify for Housebound or A&A benefits | $11,330 | 
| You qualify for Housebound benefits | $13,249| 
| You qualify for A&A benefits| $16,506| 
| You qualify for A&A benefits **and** you’re the surviving spouse of a Veteran who served in the Spanish-American War (SAW) | $17,006 | 

**Notes:** 
- The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP)/Minimum Income Annuity (MIW) limitation is $8,656.
- **If you have more than 1 child,** add $2,205 to your MAPR amount for each additional child. 
- **If you have a child who works,** you may exclude their income up to $10,400 for 2017.
- **If you have medical expenses,** you may deduct only the amount that’s above 5% of your MAPR amount ($566 for a surviving spouse with 1 dependent).

**For qualified surviving spouses with no dependents:**

| **If you have no dependents and…** | **Your MARP amount is:** |
| --- | --- |
| You don’t qualify for Housebound or A&A benefits | $8,656 |
| You qualify for Housebound benefits | $10,580 | 
| You qualify for A&A benefits | $13,836 | 
| You qualify for A&A benefits **and** you’re the surviving spouse of a Veteran who served in the Spanish-American War (SAW) | $14,397 |
