<div class="va-introtext">

If you qualify for survivors pension benefits, the amount you get will be based on the difference between your countable income and a limit that Congress sets (called the Maximum Annual Pension Rate, or MAPR). 

</div>

- **Your countable income** is how much you earn, including your salary, investment and retirement payments, and any income you may have from your dependents. Some expenses, like non-reimbursable medical expenses (paid medical expenses not covered by your insurance provider), may reduce your countable income.

- **Your MAPR amount** is the maximum amount of pension payable to a Veteran, surviving spouse, or child. Your MAPR is based on how many dependents you have and whether you qualify for Housebound or Aid and Attendance (A&A) benefits. MAPRs are adjusted each year for cost-of-living increases. You can find your current MAPR amount using the tables below.

**Example:**
You’re a qualified surviving spouse with 1 dependent child. You also qualify for A&A benefits. Your yearly income is $10,000.

Your MAPR amount = $16,506 <br>
Your yearly income = $10,000 <br>
Your VA pension = $6,506 for the year (or $542 paid each month)

### Find your Maximum Annual Pension Rate (MAPR) amount

*Date of Cost-of-Living Increase: December 1, 2016* <br>
*Increase Factor: .3%* <br>
*Standard Medicare Deduction: Actual amount will be determined by SSA based on individual income.*
