<p class="va-introtext">
VA disability pay (compensation) offers a monthly tax-free payment to Veterans who got sick or injured while serving in the military, or whose service made an existing condition worse. You may qualify for VA disability benefits for physical conditions (like a chronic illness or injury) or mental health conditions (like PTSD) that developed before, during, or after service. Find out how to apply for and manage the Veterans disability benefits you've earned.
