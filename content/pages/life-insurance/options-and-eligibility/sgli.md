### What kind of life insurance benefits can I get with SGLI?

- Coverage up to the top limit of $400,000—in $50,000 increments
- 120 days of free coverage from the date you left the military (if you’re an active-duty member)
- Extension of free coverage for up to 2 years (if you’re totally disabled, meaning you’re unable to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work) when you leave the military. See below for information on the SGLI-Disability Extension.
- Part-time coverage (if you’re a Reserve member who doesn’t qualify for full-time coverage)


### How do I get these benefits?

If you qualify for SGLI, we’ll automatically sign you up through your service branch. See your unit’s personnel office for more information.


### Can I make changes to my benefits? [UX/DESIGN NOTE: Consider accordion link here]

Yes. You can choose your level of coverage or even refuse coverage completely. You can also choose your beneficiaries (the people you pick to get the money from your life insurance policy if you die) and change them as needed.

To change your beneficiaries—or to reduce, turn down, or restore SGLI coverage—fill out VA Form 8286 (SGLI Election and Certificate) and give the form to your unit’s personnel officer.

[Download VA Form SGLV 8286](http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/8286.htm).

### How much will I pay for these benefits? [UX/DESIGN NOTE: Consider accordion link here]

If you have SGLI coverage, you’ll pay a monthly premium that’ll be automatically taken out of your base pay. The current basic SGLI premium rate is 7 cents per $1,000 of insurance. The premium includes an additional $1 per month for Traumatic Injury Protection coverage (TSGLI). [Learn more about TSGLI](/life-insurance/options-eligibility/tsgli).

These are the SGLI premium rates effective July 1, 2014.

**[DESIGN NOTE: Please insert SGLI premium rates table (see issue for content)]**

### How do I convert my SGLI when I leave the military? [UX/DESIGN NOTE: Consider accordion link here]

When you leave the military, you can apply to convert to Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI) within 1 year and 120 days from your discharge for up to the amount of coverage you had through SGLI. [Learn more about VGLI](/life-insurance/VGLI).

You can also convert your SGLI policy into a civilian policy within 120 days from the date you left the military. [Convert your SGLI policy](http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGL133_ed2015-06.pdf).


### Can I keep my free life insurance if I’m disabled when I leave the military? [UX/DESIGN NOTE: Consider accordion link here]

You may be able to keep your free coverage for up to 2 years after the date you left the military if:

- You’re within 2 years of your separation date (the date you left the military)

### How do I get this SGLI disability extension? [UX/ DESIGN NOTE: Consider accordion link here]

You’ll need to apply for the Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Disability Extension (SGLI-DE). 

To apply, fill out VA Form SGLV 8715 (SGLI Disability Extension Application) and give it to your unit’s personnel officer. [Download VA Form SGLV 8715]( http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGLV_8715.pdf).

If you do this, you’ll get a notice 20 months after your separation date letting you know that your SGLI-DE will end and that you now have the option to pay a premium for Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI).

If you pay the premium, you’ll be able to keep your life insurance coverage for as long as you keep paying the premiums. [Learn more about VGLI](/life-insurance/options-eligibility/VGLI/).
