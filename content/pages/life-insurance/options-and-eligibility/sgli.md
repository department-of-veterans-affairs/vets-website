- Coverage up to the top limit of $400,000—in $50,000 increments
- 120 days of free coverage from the date you left the military (if you’re an active-duty member)
- Extension of free coverage for up to 2 years (if you’re totally disabled) when you leave the military. See below for information on the SGLI-Disability Extension.
- Part-time coverage (if you’re a Reserve member who doesn’t qualify for full-time coverage)

### How do I get these benefits?

If you qualify for SGLI, we’ll automatically sign you up through your service branch. See your unit’s personnel office for more information.

### Can I make changes to my benefits? 

Yes. You can choose your level of coverage or even refuse coverage completely. You can also choose your beneficiaries (the people you pick to get the money from your life insurance policy if you die) and change them as needed.

To change your beneficiaries—or to reduce, turn down, or restore SGLI coverage—fill out the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Election and Certificate and give this form to your unit’s personnel officer.

[Download the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Election and Certificate](http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGLV_8286_ed2017-04.pdf).

### How much will I pay for these benefits?

If you have SGLI coverage, you’ll pay a monthly premium that’ll be automatically taken out of your base pay. The current basic SGLI premium rate is 7 cents per $1,000 of insurance coverage. The premium includes an additional $1 per month for Traumatic Injury Protection coverage (TSGLI). [Learn more about TSGLI](/life-insurance/options-and-eligibility/tsgli/).

### How do I get this SGLI disability extension? 

You’ll need to apply for the Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Disability Extension (SGLI-DE). 

To apply, fill out the SGLI Disability Extension Application and give it to your unit’s personnel officer. [Download the SGLI Disability Extension Application](http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGLV_8715.pdf).

If you do this, you’ll get a notice 20 months after your separation date letting you know that your SGLI-DE will end and that you now have the option to pay a premium for Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI).

If you pay the premium, you’ll be able to keep your life insurance coverage for as long as you keep paying the premiums. [Learn more about VGLI](/life-insurance/options-and-eligibility/vgli/).
