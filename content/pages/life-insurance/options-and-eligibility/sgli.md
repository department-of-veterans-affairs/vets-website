### What kind of life insurance benefits can I get with SGLI?

- Coverage up to the top limit of $400,000—in $50,000 increments
- 120 days of free coverage from the date you left the military (if you’re an active-duty member)
- Extension of free coverage for up to 2 years (if you’re totally disabled, meaning you’re unable to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work) when you leave the military. See below for information on the SGLI-Disability Extension.
- Part-time coverage (if you’re a Reserve member who doesn’t qualify for full-time coverage)

### How do I get these benefits?

If you qualify for SGLI, we’ll automatically sign you up through your service branch. See your unit’s personnel office for more information.

### Can I make changes to my benefits? 

Yes. You can choose your level of coverage or even refuse coverage completely. You can also choose your beneficiaries (the people you pick to get the money from your life insurance policy if you die) and change them as needed.

To change your beneficiaries—or to reduce, turn down, or restore SGLI coverage—fill out VA Form 8286 (SGLI Election and Certificate) and give the form to your unit’s personnel officer.

[Download VA Form SGLV 8286](http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/8286.htm).

### How much will I pay for these benefits?

If you have SGLI coverage, you’ll pay a monthly premium that’ll be automatically taken out of your base pay. The current basic SGLI premium rate is 7 cents per $1,000 of insurance coverage. The premium includes an additional $1 per month for Traumatic Injury Protection coverage (TSGLI). [Learn more about TSGLI](/life-insurance/options-and-eligibility/tsgli/).

These are the SGLI premium rates effective July 1, 2014.

You may be able to keep your free coverage for up to 2 years after the date you left the military if you're within 2 years of your separation date and:

- You’re rated 100% disabled at the time of your discharge due to being totally unable to work, **or**
- No matter your work status, you’ve had 1 of the following:
  - Total loss of hearing in both ears

### How do I get this SGLI disability extension? 

You’ll need to apply for the Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Disability Extension (SGLI-DE). 

To apply, fill out VA Form SGLV 8715 (SGLI Disability Extension Application) and give it to your unit’s personnel officer. [Download VA Form SGLV 8715](http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGLV_8715.pdf).

If you do this, you’ll get a notice 20 months after your separation date letting you know that your SGLI-DE will end and that you now have the option to pay a premium for Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI).

If you pay the premium, you’ll be able to keep your life insurance coverage for as long as you keep paying the premiums. [Learn more about VGLI](/life-insurance/options-and-eligibility/vgli/).
