<div class="va-introtext">

Are you the spouse or dependent child of a Servicemember who’s covered under Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI)? If you are, you may qualify for term life insurance coverage through Family Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (FSGLI). Find out if you qualify—and how to manage your coverage.

</div>

<div class="feature">

### Can I get FSGLI? 

You may be able to get FSGLI if you’re the spouse or dependent child of:

- An active-duty Servicemember covered by full-time SGLI, **or**
- A member of the National Guard or Ready Reserve covered by full-time SGLI

You can get FSGLI as the spouse of someone with SGLI coverage no matter if your own status is active duty, retired, or civilian.

<br>

#### Who’s covered?

-	Spouses of Servicemembers covered under SGLI
-	Dependent children of Servicemembers covered under SGLI

</div>

### What kind of life insurance benefits can I get with FSGLI?

Up to a maximum of $100,000 of coverage for you as a spouse, not to exceed your Servicemember’s SGLI coverage, and $10,000 for each dependent child. Dependent children get free coverage. 

### How do I get these benefits?

- **If you’re the civilian spouse of a Servicemember signed up for full-time SGLI**, we’ll automatically insure you under FSGLI. In this case, we’ll automatically take your premium out of your Servicemember’s pay.

- **If you’re a military spouse and you were married on or after January 2, 2013**, we won’t automatically cover you. You’ll need to sign up using the Spouse Coverage Election and Certificate. Fill out this form and have your Servicemember hand it in to the personnel office for their unit. [Download the Spouse Coverage Election and Certificate](http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGLV_8286A_ed2017-04.PDF).

### How much will my Servicemember pay for spousal coverage—and how do the premium payments work?

Your Servicemember will pay a premium for your coverage, which will increase as you age. Choose your age below to view current spousal coverage monthly premium rates based on the amount of insurance coverage you want.

If you’re signed up as a spouse in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), we’ll automatically deduct the FSGLI premium from your Servicemember’s pay. If you aren’t signed up in DEERS, your Servicemember will still be responsible for premiums and back payments of unpaid premiums. 

### Can my Servicemember make changes to my coverage? 

Yes. If you have spousal coverage and you want to reduce, turn down, or cancel it, fill out the Spouse Coverage Election and Certificate and have your Servicemember turn it in to the personnel office for their unit. [Download the Spouse Coverage Election and Certificate](http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGLV_8286A_ed2014-06.PDF). 

**Note:** We automatically cover dependent children. This coverage can’t be turned down, reduced, or canceled.

### How much will my Servicemember pay for dependent coverage? 

Nothing. We provide dependent coverage at no cost until the child is 18 years old, unless the child:
- Is a full-time student, **or**
- Becomes permanently and totally disabled—before turning 18—and can’t support themselves 

### Can my Servicemember get extended coverage for our dependent child? 

Yes, in some cases. Coverage lasts until the child is 18 years old. But, if the child is a full-time student between 18 and 22 years old, we may extend the coverage. Or, if the child becomes permanently and totally disabled before turning 18 and is no longer able to support themselves, we may extend the coverage—in some cases indefinitely.

### How do I convert a spousal FSGLI policy to an individual insurance policy? 

You have the option to convert spousal FSGLI coverage to a permanent, individual insurance policy (such as whole life) within 120 days from the date of your Servicemember’s:

- Separation from the military
- Divorce from you
- Written election to end spousal SGLI coverage
- Written election to end their SGLI coverage
- Death

If any of the above events happen, you, as the Servicemember's spouse, become solely responsible for all aspects of the policy, including premium payments.

You can’t convert other types of policies—such as term, variable, or universal life insurance. And, supplementary policy benefits—such as accidental death and dismemberment or a waiver of the premium for disability—aren’t considered part of the conversion policy.

**If you’d like to convert FSGLI coverage, you must also:**

- Choose a company from the list of companies that take part in this program. [View the companies you can choose from](http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/ParticList.htm).
- Apply at the local sales office of the company you chose
- Give a copy of the most recent Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) to the agent, showing the deduction for spousal SGLI. You’ll also have to provide proof of coverage with one of these documents:
 - The Servicemember's separation document (Form DD214 or NGB-22, or written orders)
 - The Certificate of Dissolution of Marriage between the spouse and the Servicemember
 - The Servicemember's FSGLI spousal declination
 - The Servicemember's SGLI declination
 - The Servicemember's proof of death (DD1300: Report of Casualty, or a civilian death certificate)
