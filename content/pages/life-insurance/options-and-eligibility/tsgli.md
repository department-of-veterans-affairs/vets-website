### Can I get TSGLI? 

You may be able to get TSGLI if you were insured by SGLI when you experienced a traumatic injury and you:

- Have a scheduled loss that is a direct result of the traumatic injury, **and**
- Suffered the traumatic injury before midnight on the day that you left the military, **and**
- Suffered a scheduled loss within 2 years (730 days) of the traumatic injury, **and**
- Have survived for a period of not less than 7 full days from the date of the traumatic injury (the 7-day period begins on the date and time of the traumatic injury and ends 168 full hours later), **and**
- Were an active-duty military member, a Reservist, a National Guard member, on funeral-honors duty, or on 1-day muster duty

### Can I get retroactive TSGLI?

You may be able to get retroactive TSGLI (meaning that it takes effect starting from a date in the past) if you were injured between October 7, 2001, and November 30, 2005, and:

- Your injury was not self-inflicted on purpose or an attempt at self-injury, **and**
- Your injury didn’t involve the use of an illegal drug or a controlled substance that was given or taken without the advice of a medical doctor, **and**
- You weren’t injured as the result of medical or surgical treatment of an illness or disease, **and**
- You weren’t injured while committing or trying to commit a felony, **and**
- You weren’t injured by a physical or mental illness or disease (not including illness or disease caused by a wound infection; a chemical, biological, or radiological weapon; or accidentally swallowing a contaminated substance)

You can use this benefit no matter where the injury happened—whether you were on or off duty—and no matter if your coverage was in effect when you got injured.

**Note:** We’ve removed the previous requirement that you must have been injured during Operations Enduring or Iraqi Freedom (OEF or OIF). [Find out if you qualify for retroactive benefits](http://www.benefits.va.gov/insurance/tsgli-claim-questionnaire.asp).

### What kind of life insurance benefits can I get through TSGLI?

Short-term financial support to help in your recovery from a traumatic injury.

### How do I get these benefits?

You’re automatically covered through TSGLI if you’re signed up for full-time SGLI. This insurance covers you even if your injury happened while you were off duty.

To get payments—including retroactive TSGLI payments—you’ll need to apply. To file a claim, fill out VA Form SGLV 8600 (Application for TSGLI Benefits), and fax, email, or mail it to us. Look for the address of your service branch on the front page of the form.

[Download VA Form SGLV 8600](http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGLV_8600_ed2017-01.pdf).

### How do I appeal a decision if I’m denied benefits?

First, look at the denial letter you received from your branch of service. Your letter will tell you if you should use VA Form SGLV 8600A: TSGLI Appeal Request—and how long you’ll have to submit your appeal.

If your letter says to complete this form, fill out the form and submit it to your branch of service.

[Download VA Form SGLV 8600A](http://benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGLV_8600A_ed2017-01.pdf). 

### How much will I pay for these benefits? 

If you have SGLI coverage, your SGLI premium (which is automatically deducted from your base pay) includes a $1-per-month flat-rate premium for TSGLI. This is all you’ll pay for this benefit.
