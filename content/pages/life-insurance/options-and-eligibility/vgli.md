### Can I convert my VGLI policy into a civilian policy? [UX/Design note: Consider accordion link here]

Yes. You can convert your policy into a civilian (or commercial) policy at any time. You’ll be able to convert at standard premium rates, without having to provide proof that you’re in good health.

To convert your VGLI policy:

1.	Choose your new insurance company. [View our list of companies that take part in this program]( http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGL133_ed2016-06.pdf).

2.	Apply at the local sales office of your chosen company.

3.	Get a letter from OSGLI confirming that you have VGLI coverage (called a VGLI Conversion Notice) and give the letter to the agent who takes your application.

**Note:** The conversion policy must be a permanent policy, such as a whole life policy. You can’t convert to other types of policies, like Term, Variable Life, or Universal Life Insurance. And supplementary policy benefits, like Accidental Death and Dismemberment or Waiver of Premium for Disability, aren’t considered part of the conversion policy.
