### Can I get VGLI? 

You may be able to get VGLI if:

- You had part-time Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) as a member of the National Guard or Reserves, and you suffered an    injury or disability (damage to your body or mind that makes it hard for you to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work) while on duty—including direct traveling to and from duty—that disqualified you for standard premium insurance rates, **or**
- You had SGLI while you were in the military and you’re within 1 year and 120 days of being released from an active-duty period of 31 or more days, **or**
- You’re within 1 year and 120 days of retiring or being released from the Ready Reserves or National Guard, **or**
- You’re within 1 year and 120 days of assignment to the Individual Ready Reserves (IRR) of a branch of service, or to the Inactive National Guard (ING). This includes members of the United States Public Health Service Inactive Reserve Corps (IRC), **or**

### What life insurance benefits can I get with VGLI?

$10,000 to $400,000 in life insurance benefits, based on the amount of SGLI coverage you had when you left the military.

When you leave the military, you can sign up through VGLI for coverage up to the amount of coverage you had through SGLI. You can also increase your coverage by $25,000 every 5 years—up to $400,000—until you’re 60 years old.

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for these benefits. When you apply, you won't need to prove you’re in good health as long as you sign up within 240 days of leaving the military.

### Can I convert my VGLI policy into a civilian policy? 

Yes. You can convert your policy into a civilian (or commercial) policy at any time. You’ll be able to convert at standard premium rates, without having to provide proof that you’re in good health.

To convert your VGLI policy:

<ol class="process">

<li class="step one">

Choose your new insurance company. [View our list of companies that take part in this program]( http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGL133_ed2016-06.pdf).
</li>

<li class="step two">

Apply at the local sales office of your chosen company.
</li>

<li class="step three">

Get a letter from OSGLI confirming that you have VGLI coverage (called a VGLI Conversion Notice) and give the letter to the agent who takes your application.
</li>
**Note:** The conversion policy must be a permanent policy, such as a whole life policy. You can’t convert to other types of policies, like Term, Variable Life, or Universal Life Insurance. And supplementary policy benefits, like Accidental Death and Dismemberment or Waiver of Premium for Disability, aren’t considered part of the conversion policy.
