<div class="va-introtext">

If you have a disability that we’ve concluded was caused—or made worse—by your active service, you may be able to get life insurance under Service-Disabled Veterans Insurance (S-DVI). Find out if you qualify—and how to manage your coverage.

</div>

<div class="feature">

### Can I apply for S-DVI? 

You can apply for S-DVI if you meet these 4 criteria:

- You were released from active duty under other than dishonorable conditions on or after April 25, 1951
- You were rated for a service-connected disability (even if only 0%)
- You're in good health except for any service-connected conditions
- You apply within 2 years from the date we grant your new service-connected disability

**Note:** An increase of a rating you had before—or a rating of Individual Unemployability, meaning you can’t work—doesn’t qualify you for S-DVI.

<br>

### Can I get more life insurance coverage if I need it? 

If you carry the basic S-DVI coverage and become totally disabled and unable to work, you can apply to get up to $30,000 more in coverage. This is called Supplemental S-DVI coverage.

You may be able to get $30,000 of supplemental coverage if you qualify for a premiums waiver, and you:
- Apply for the coverage within 1 year from the date you get notice of the grant of waiver, **and**
- Are younger than age 65

### Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance (VMLI)

If you have a severe service-connected disability that we’ve concluded was caused—or made worse—by your service, you may be able to get Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance (VMLI). In the event of your death, this mortgage protection insurance can help your family pay off the home mortgage on a home that’s been adapted to meet your needs. 

To get VMLI, you’ll need to apply for our Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grant. The SAH grant can help you buy, build, or make changes (like installing ramps or widening doorways) to a home so you can live more independently. When you receive an SAH grant, your Loan Guaranty agent will tell you if you qualify for VMLI and will help you apply. <br>
