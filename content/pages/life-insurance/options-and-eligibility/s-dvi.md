<div class="va-introtext">

If you have a disability (damage to your body or mind that makes you less able to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work) that we’ve concluded was caused—or made worse—by your active service, you may be able to get life insurance under Service-Disabled Veterans’ Insurance (S-DVI). Find out if you qualify—and how to manage your coverage.

</div>

<div class="feature">

### Can I get S-DVI? 

You may be able to get S-DVI if you’ve gotten a disability rating of 0% or more for a new service-connected condition (an illness or injury caused—or made worse—by service in the military) in the past 2 years, and you: 

- Are in good health—except for your service-connected condition, **and**
- Left the military on or after April 25, 1951, **and**
- Were discharged under conditions other than dishonorable

**Note:** A disability rating measures how bad your disability is (with 0% being not at all disabled and 100% being totally disabled). An increase of a rating you had before—or a rating of Individual Unemployability (meaning you can’t work)—doesn’t qualify you for S-DVI.

<br>

### Can I get more life insurance coverage if I need it? 

If you carry the basic S-DVI coverage and become totally disabled (totally unable to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work), you can apply to get up to $30,000 more in coverage. This is called Supplemental S-DVI coverage.

You may also be able to get $30,000 of supplemental coverage if you qualify for a premiums waiver, and you:
- Apply for the coverage within 1 year from the date you get notice of the grant of waiver, **and**
- Are younger than age 65
