<div class="va-introtext">

If you or your spouse becomes totally disabled or terminally ill, you may be able to get certain benefits. Being totally disabled means you’re totally unable to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work. Being terminally ill means you’re sick with an illness that can’t be cured and that will likely result in death within a short period of time. Find out what benefits you qualify for—and how to get them.

### Accelerated benefits for terminally ill policyholders

<br>

<div class="feature">

#### Can I get my life insurance benefits early if I’m terminally ill?
 
You may be able to get your benefits early if:
-	You have SGLI, Family SGLI, or VGLI life insurance, **and**
-	You or a covered spouse has a written statement from a doctor saying you have 9 months or less to live

<br>

##### Who’s covered?

-	Veterans
-	Servicemembers
-	Covered spouses of Veterans and Servicemembers

</div>


#### What benefits can I get?
 
Up to 50% of the face value of your coverage in increments of $5,000—paid to you before death


#### How do I get these benefits?
 
Only the insured may apply for accelerated benefits. No one may apply on their behalf. In the case of a terminally ill spouse, only the insured may apply. Use the application form for the type of coverage you have:
 
- **If you’re an SGLI or VGLI policyholder**, fill out VA Form SGLV 8284 (Claim for Accelerated Benefits). If you’re still on active duty, your service branch must also fill out part of the form. [Download VA Form SGLV 8284](http://benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/8284.htm).

- **If you’re covered under Family SGLI**, fill out VA Form SGLV 8284A (Claim for Accelerated Benefits). [Download VA Form SGLV 8284A](http://benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/8284A.htm).
 
You’ll need to fill out 1 part of the application, and your doctor will need to fill out another part of the application.
 
Send the completed form to:

<dl class="va-address-block">
<dd>Office of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance</dd>
<dd>80 Livingston Avenue</dd>
<dd>Roseland, NJ 07068-1733</dd>
</dl>
 
We pay the remaining amount of the face value of the insurance policy to your designated beneficiary or beneficiaries (the people you’ve picked to get the money from your policy) upon your death. In the case of a terminally ill spouse, we pay the rest of the insurance policy to you upon your spouse's death.

### Waiver of premiums for policyholders who become totally disabled

<br>

<div class="feature">

#### Can I get a waiver so I don’t have to pay my life insurance premiums?

You may be able to get a waiver of your life insurance premiums if you have a mental or physical disability that prevents you from being able to hold a job, and your total disability:
-	Happens before you’re 65 years old—but after the effective date of your life insurance policy, **and**
-	Continues for at least 6 months in a row

There are certain exceptions to the above conditions. But if you think you’re entitled to a waiver of premiums, you should apply as soon as possible and we’ll let you know if you qualify.

</div>


#### What benefits can I get?

A waiver of premiums. This means you won’t have to pay your life insurance premiums (the monthly payments you make to hold your policy). In most cases, premiums can only be waived up to 1 year prior to receipt of a claim.


#### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for these benefits as soon as possible after becoming totally disabled. We’ll decide if you qualify, and we’ll notify you of the decision.

To apply, fill out and sign VA Form 29-357 (Claim for Disability Insurance). Mail it to:

<dl class="va-address-block">
<dd>Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office and Insurance Center (WP)</dd>
<dd>P.O. Box 7208</dd>
<dd>Philadelphia, PA 19101</dd>

### Total disability income provision (TDIP) rider for policyholders who become totally disabled

<br>

<div class="feature">

#### Can I get life insurance payments if I become totally disabled?

You may be able to get monthly payments if you have a mental or physical disability that prevents you from being able to hold a job, and your total disability:
-	Happens before you’re 65 years old—but on or after the effective date of your TDIP rider or within 1 year of when the rider ends, **and**
-	Continues for at least 6 months in a row

</div>


#### What life insurance benefits can I get with a TDIP rider?

-	Monthly payments to be paid to you starting on the 1st day of the 7th month of your continued total disability and continuing as long as you remain totally disabled
-	A waiver of premiums so you won’t need to pay your premium (monthly payments) for your life insurance coverage


#### How do I get these benefits?

To get these benefits, you’ll need to have had a TDIP rider on your existing life insurance plan before you became totally disabled. 

To get a TDIP rider, you’ll need to:
-	Have an NSLI policy on which the TDIP rider is available (which is all policies except S-DVI [RH] and VRI [JR and JS]), **and** 
-	Be under 55 years of age when you apply, **and**
-	Be in good health when you apply

If you have a TDIP rider on your policy and you become totally disabled, you’ll need to file a claim for TDIP payments. To do this, fill out VA Form 29-357 (Claim for Disability Insurance) and mail it to:
