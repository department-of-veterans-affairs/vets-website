We offer grants to Servicemembers and Veterans with certain service-connected disabilities to buy or change a home to meet their needs and live more independently. Changing a home might involve installing ramps or widening doorways. If you’re a disabled Servicemember or Veteran, find out if you can get a grant to help meet your housing needs.
