### How can I get a cash-out refinance loan?

<ol class="process">
<li class="step one">

**Find a lender.** You’ll go through a private bank or mortgage company—not directly through us—to get a cash-out refinance loan. Terms and fees may vary, so contact several lenders to check out your options.

</li>

<li class="step two">

**Apply for your VA-backed home loan Certificate of Eligibility (COE).** You’ll need to show your COE to your lender as proof that you qualify for the home loan benefit. <br />

<li class="step three">

**Give your lender any needed information.** In addition to your COE, you’ll need to give your lender:
-	Copies of paycheck stubs for the most recent 30-day period
-	W-2 forms for the previous 2 years
-	A copy of your federal income tax returns for the previous 2 years (required by many, but not all lenders)
-	Any other information your lender requires

**Note:** The lender will order a home appraisal, an expert assessment of the value of your home.

</li>

<li class="step last four">

**Follow your lender’s process for closing on the loan, and pay your closing costs.**
