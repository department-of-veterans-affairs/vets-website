<div class="va-introtext">

With a VA-backed Purchase Loan, we can help you buy a home at a competitive interest rate—and if you’ve had trouble finding other financing. Find out if you can get this loan—and how to apply. 

</div>

<div class="feature">

### Can I get a VA-backed Purchase Loan?

You may be able to get a VA-backed Purchase Loan if you:
-	[Qualify for a VA-backed home loan Certificate of Eligibility (COE)](/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/), **and**
-	Meet your lender’s standards for credit, income, and any other requirements, **and**
-	Will live in the home you’re buying with the loan

</div>

### Why might I want a VA-backed Purchase Loan?

A VA-backed Purchase Loan often offers:

- **Better terms and interest rates** than regular loans from private banks or mortgage companies (also called lenders)
- **No down payment** as long as the sales price isn’t higher than the home’s appraised value (the value set for the home after an expert reviews the property)
- **No need for private mortgage insurance** (PMI, a type of insurance that protects the lender if you end up not being able to pay your mortgage. PMI is usually required if you make a down payment of less than 20% of the total mortgage amount.)
- **Fewer closing costs,** which *may* be paid by the seller
- **No penalty fee** if you pay the loan off early

If you qualify for a VA-backed home loan, you can use the loan to:

-	Buy a house or a condo unit in a VA-approved project
-	Buy a home and improve it
-	Buy a manufactured home or lot
-	Build a new home
-	Make changes or add new features (like solar power) to make your home more energy efficient

You can also:

- Get a VA-backed home loan to buy your first home
- Use your VA loan benefit again if you sell or refinance a home you bought with a VA-backed home loan
- Assume a VA-backed home loan (which means that instead of opening a new mortgage loan, the buyer takes over the seller’s loan)
- Have 2 VA loans at the same time—as long as the total amount of the loans is under the top amount allowed for VA-backed loans

### How can I buy a home with a VA-backed Purchase Loan?

Buying a home is a complex process—and getting a VA-backed home loan is only 1 piece of the puzzle. Stay on track by following the steps below.

#### Steps to finding a home

<ol class="process">
<li class="step one">

**Look at your current finances.** Go over your credit score, income, expenses, and monthly budget. Make sure you’re ready to buy a home—and decide how much you want to spend on a mortgage. Don’t forget to include closing costs. [Get more advice from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home/process/prepare/). 

</li>

<li class="step two">

**Find a lender.** You’ll go through a private bank or mortgage company—not through us—to get your loan. Lenders offer different loan interest rates and fees, so shop around for the loan that best meets your needs. 

</li>

<li class="step three">

**Apply for your VA-backed home loan Certificate of Eligibility (COE).** You’ll need to show your COE to your lender as proof that you qualify for the home loan benefit.

</li>

<li class="step four">

**Find a real estate agent.** Read all agreements—and make sure you understand any charges, fees, and commissions—before signing with an agent.

</li>

<li class="step last five">

**Shop for a home.** Look at homes in your price range until you find one that works for you.

</li>
</ol>

#### Steps to buying your home

Once you’ve found the home you want to buy:

<ol class="process">
<li class="step one">

**Work with your agent to put together and sign a purchase agreement.** Be sure the sales contract includes the “VA Escape Clause.” This voids the contract if the property doesn’t appraise for the contract price. 

</li>

<li class="step two">

**Have the home appraised and inspected.** A VA-approved appraiser will appraise the house to make sure it meets basic property condition requirements. You’ll also want to hire a certified inspector to check for any major defects.

</li>

<li class="step three">

**Read the Closing Disclosure.** Your lender must give you a Closing Disclosure at least 3 business days before closing. Read this carefully. It includes loan terms, fees, closing costs, and your estimated monthly mortgage payments.

</li>

<li class="step four">

**Complete all paperwork from your lender.** You may need to provide more information or documents to your lender during this phase.  

</li>

<li class="step five">

**Go to the closing meeting.** This may be held at a title company, escrow office, or attorney’s office. Be prepared to sign a lot of documents—and be sure to take the time to read everything before you sign.

</li>

<li class="step last six">

**Move in.** After closing, you’re ready to move into your new home. Congratulations!
