<div class="va-introtext">

If you’re a Veteran and you—or your spouse—is a Native American, our Native American Direct Loans (NADL) program may help you get a loan to buy, build, or improve a home on Federal Trust Land. You may also get a loan to refinance an existing NADL and reduce your interest rate. Find out if you qualify for a NADL—and how to apply.

### Can I get a NADL?

You may be able to get a NADL if you’re a Native American Veteran or a non–Native American Veteran married to a Native American, **and**:

-	Your tribal government has an agreement—or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)—with us detailing how the program will work on its trust lands, **and**
-	You have a valid VA home loan Certificate of Eligibility (COE), **and**
-	You have good enough credit, **and**
-	You have proof that you make enough money to cover the mortgage payments and other costs of owning a home, **and**
-	You’ll live in the home you’re using the NADL to buy, build, or improve
[Learn more about the MOU](http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/nadl_mou.asp).


</div>

### Why might I want to get a NADL?

A NADL often offers better terms than a home loan from a private bank or mortgage company (called a lender), including:

-	No down payment required in most cases
-	No need for Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI is a type of insurance that protects the lender if you can’t pay your mortgage. PMI is usually required if you make a down payment of less than 20% of the total mortgage amount.)
-	Low closing costs (fees you pay for services and other costs related to getting a loan and buying a home)
-	A low-interest, 30-year fixed mortgage (a fixed mortgage means your interest rate will stay the same over the full life of the loan)
-	A reusable benefit (which means you can get more than 1 NADL to buy, build, or improve another home in the future)
-	The ability to borrow up to $417,000 in most areas (with higher loan limits for some high-cost counties)

### How do I get a NADL?

<ol class="process">
<li class="step one">

First, apply for a VA home loan Certificate of Eligibility (COE). This certification confirms that you qualify for the VA home loan benefit.

[Find out if you can get a COE based on your service history and duty status](/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility).
[Apply for your COE](/housing-assistance/home-loans/apply-for-COE).

Then, contact the VA regional loan center for your state to begin the NADL process. [Find your state’s VA regional loan center](http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/contact_rlc_info.asp).
