#### Apply for your COE

You can apply in 1 of 3 ways:

**Online through eBenefits** 

We recommend applying for your COE online.

<a class="usa-button-primary va-button-primary" href="http://www.ebenefits.va.gov/">Go to eBenefits to Apply</a>

**Through our Web LGY system** 

In some cases, you can get your COE through your lender using our Web LGY system. Ask your lender about this option.

**By mail** 

To apply by mail, fill out VA Form 26-1880 (Request for a Certificate of Eligibility) and mail it to the address listed on the form. Please keep in mind that this may take longer than applying online or through our Web LGY system. [Download Form 26-1880](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-26-1880-are.pdf).

### Next steps for getting a VA-backed home loan

Applying for your COE is only one part of the process for getting a VA-backed home loan. Your next steps will depend on the type of loan you’re looking to get—and on your lender (for most loans, the lender will be a private bank or mortgage company; for the Native American Direct Loan, we’ll be your lender).
