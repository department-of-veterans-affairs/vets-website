<div class="va-introtext">

The first step in getting a VA-backed home loan is to apply for a Certificate of Eligibility (COE). This confirms for your lender that you qualify for the VA home loan benefit. Find out how to apply for a COE. Then, choose your loan type to learn about the rest of the loan application process.

### Next steps for getting a VA-backed home loan

Applying for your COE is only 1 part of the process for getting a VA-backed home loan. Your next steps will depend on the type of loan you’re looking to get—and on your lender (for most loans, this will be a private bank or mortgage company; for the Native American Direct Loan, we’ll be your lender).
