### Next steps for getting a VA-backed home loan

Applying for your COE is only one part of the process for getting a VA-backed home loan. Your next steps will depend on the type of loan you’re looking to get—and on your lender (for most loans, the lender will be a private bank or mortgage company; for the Native American Direct Loan, we’ll be your lender).
