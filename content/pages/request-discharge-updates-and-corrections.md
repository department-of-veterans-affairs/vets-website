                  Note that the DoD especially encourages you to apply for an upgrade if your discharge was connected to any of these categories:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Mental health conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) </li>
                  <li>Traumatic brain injury (TBI)</li>
                  <li>Sexual assault or harassment during military service</li>
                  <li>Sexual orientation (i.e., Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, and its predecessor policies)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The information you enter is completely confidential.

                        <p>If you have previously made a discharge upgrade application, you may have to follow a different process. Note that, unless you have new information to add to your application, re-applying is not likely to change the outcome of your case, unless you fall into one of the special groups that the Department of Defense has issued new guidance for.</p>
                        <h4>Denied Upgrade After Records Review</h4>
                        <p>If your last application was decided by a Discharge Review Board (DRB) Records Review, you may re-apply to the DRB for a Personal Appearance Review—as long as the details of your application can be handled by DRB. (This means: your discharge was less than 15 years ago; your discharge was <strong>not</strong> the result of a General Court-Martial; and you do <strong>not</strong> want to change elements of your paperwork other than discharge status, re-enlistment code, and narrative reason for discharge. If your case cannot be handled by the DRB, you should apply to the Board for Correction of Military Records (BCMR) or the Board for Correction of Naval Records (BCNR) for your branch of service, not matter where you sent your previous application.)</p>
                        <h4>Denied Upgrade After Personal Appearance Review</h4>
                        <p>If your last application was decided by a DRB Personal Appearance Review, you must appeal to the BCMR/BCNR for your branch of service. You generally have 3 years to make this appeal, from the date of your denial by DRB, though the Board can decide to waive that deadline.</p>
                        <h4>PTSD or Other Mental Health Conditions</h4>
                        <p>If you’re applying for reasons related to PTSD or other mental health conditions <strong>and</strong> your last application was before 2014, your application will be effectively considered a new application (although your previous application may be consulted for evidence). This is because in 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued new guidance about carefully considering less-than-honorable discharge statuses related to PTSD or other mental health conditions.</p>
                        <h4>TBI</h4>
                        <p>If you’re applying for reasons related to TBI <strong>and</strong> your last application was before 2014, your application will be effectively considered a new application (although your previous application may be consulted for evidence). This is because in 2014, DoD issued new guidance about carefully considering less-than-honorable discharge statuses related to TBI.</p>
                        <h4>Homosexual Conduct</h4>
                        <p>If you’re applying for reasons related to homosexual conduct <strong>and</strong> your last application was before 2011, your application will be effectively considered a new application (although your previous application may be consulted for evidence). This is because in 2011, DoD issued new guidance about carefully considering less-than-honorable discharge statuses related to homosexual conduct.</p>
                        <h4>Sexual Assault</h4>
                        <p>If you’re applying for reasons related to sexual assault in the military <strong>and</strong> your last application was before 2017, your application will be effectively considered a new application (although your previous application may be consulted for evidence). This is because in 2017, DoD issued new guidance about carefully considering less-than-honorable discharge statuses related to sexual assault in the military.</p>

                        <p>If the Department of Defense (DoD) determined you served honorably in one period of service, you may use that honorable characterization to establish eligibility for VA benefits, even if you later received a less than honorable discharge. You earned your benefits during the period in which you served honorably.</p>
                        <p>The only exception is for service-connected disability compensation. You are only eligible to earn disability compensation for disabilities you suffered during a period of honorable service. You can’t use an honorable discharge from one period of service to establish eligibility for a service-connected disability from a different period.</p>

                        <p>If the Department of Defense determined you served honorably in one period of service, you may use that honorable characterization to establish eligibility for VA benefits. You earned your benefits during the period in which you served honorably.</p>
                        <p>This is true even if you didn’t receive an actual discharge at the end of the first period. If you completed your original contract period without any disciplinary problems, you can use this period of service to establish your eligibility, even if you re-enlisted or extended your service and did not receive a ‘Honorable’ DD-214. However, this eligibility determination may not be automatic. If you believe there is a period of service that entitles you to benefits, but which is not reflected on a DD-214, you will likely need to ask the VA to do a Character of Service Determination. (See below.)</p>

You’re only eligible to earn disability compensation for disabilities you suffered during a period of honorable service. You can’t use an honorable discharge from one period of service to establish eligibility for a service-connected disability from a different period.</p>
