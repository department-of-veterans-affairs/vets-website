[A VA Employment Coordinator](http://www.benefits.va.gov/VOCREHAB/docs/EmploymentCoordinators.xls) (EC) can help you put together your résumé, develop your interview skills, and connect you with employers interested in hiring Veterans.

[Veterans ReEmployment](http://www.careeronestop.org/ReEmployment/veterans/default.aspx) connects you with employment services and jobs that use the skills you learned in the military. It also helps with job-search strategies, getting copies of military records, and choosing the right schools or training programs.

[My Next Move for Vets](http://www.mynextmove.org/vets/) helps you look for a new career or find a civilian career that's like your military job.

[Hire Heroes USA](https://www.hireheroesusa.org/about-us/) connects you with successful business professionals and helps you explain your military skills on your résumé or in private-sector interviews.

[Operation Pave: Paving Access for Veterans Employment](http://www.pva.org/site/c.ajIRK9NJLcJ2E/b.7750849/k.36C/Operation_PAVE_Paving_Access_for_Veterans_Employment.htm) helps Veterans with spinal-cord injuries find jobs and access resources for workplace accommodations. Workplace accommodations are changes or adjustments to a job, work environment, or work process that set you up to do your job despite your disability. Examples of workplace accommodations include special equipment, ramps to make buildings wheelchair accessible, or modified work schedules.

You may also qualify for a monthly subsistence allowance—like Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)—while you're in an educational or training program. [See the current subsistence allowance rates](http://www.benefits.va.gov/VOCREHAB/subsistence_allowance_rates.asp).
