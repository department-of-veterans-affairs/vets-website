VetSuccess on Campus supports Veterans, Servicemembers, and some qualified family members in their transition from military to college life. We have Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors (VRCs) at 94 college campuses across the country. Our VRCs can help you with your Veterans’ benefits, health services, and education benefits. They can also show you how to get referrals for health services and disability accommodations (like help with taking notes or completing writing assignments) in the classroom. [Find out if your college has a VRC](http://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/vsoc.asp).

### How do I know if I'm a qualified family member?

You can get help through this program if you're the dependent of a Servicemember or Veteran and you:
- [Qualify for the Fry Scholarship](/education/gi-bill/survivors-dependent-assistance/fry-scholarship/), **or**
- [Qualify for the Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program](/education/gi-bill/survivors-dependent-assistance/dependents-education), **or**
- Have had GI Bill benefits transferred to you from a spouse or parent
