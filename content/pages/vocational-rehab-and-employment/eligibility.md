<div class="va-introtext">

If you have a disability that was caused by—or got worse because of—your active military service and that limits your ability to work or prevents you from working, you may be eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) benfits and services. Find out if you can get career support or help living more independently.

### Can I get VR&amp;E benefits?

#### Servicemembers

You may be eligible for VR&amp;E benefits if you're a Servicemember who:

- Has a 20% or higher predischarge disability rating (memorandum rating) and will soon leave the military, **or**
- Is participating in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) process or awaiting discharge due to a medical condition resulting from a serious injury or illness that occurred in the line of duty

**Note:** IDES helps to determine a Servicemember’s fitness for duty. It’s run in partnership by VA and the Department of Defense (DoD). If you’re in this system and you’re found to be medically unfit for duty, you’ll get a proposed VA disability rating before you leave the service and you may be entitled to VR&E services. You’ll need to report for an evaluation with a VR&E counselor before separating from active duty.

<br>

#### Veterans

You may be eligible for VR&amp;E benefits if you're a Veteran who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable and you:
- Have a 10% or higher disability rating, **and**
- Separated from the military or received a service-connected disability rating from VA within the past 12 years

You may also be eligible for VR&amp;E benefits if you're a Veteran who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable, and you:
- Have a Serious Employment Handicap (SEH) due in large part to a service-connected disability, **and**
- Have a 10% disability rating, **or**
- Are beyond the 12-year basic period of eligibility

**Note:** Having a service-connected disability means we’ve concluded that you were disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by your active military service.
