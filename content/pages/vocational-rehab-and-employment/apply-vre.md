<div class="va-introtext">

If you're a service-disabled Servicemember or Veteran interested in career counseling, training, or other career-related support, follow these steps to apply for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) benefits. 

</div>

<ol class="process">

<li class="step one">

Check to see if you qualify for VR&amp;E benefits—and choose your program track. [Find out if you qualify for programs for service-disabled Servicemembers and Veterans](/vocational-rehab-and-employment/service-disabled/). 

</li>

<li class="step two">

[Log in to your eBenefits account](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage).

</li>

<li class="step three">

Choose **Additional Benefits** on your dashboard.

</li>

<li class="step four">

Choose **Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program**.

</li>

<li class="step five">

Apply for the **Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program**. 

</li>

<li class="step six">

If you qualify, we'll invite you to an orientation session at your nearest VA Regional Office.

</li>

<li class="step seven">

If you're a Servicemember who hasn't yet received a service-connected disability rating, you don't need to wait for a rating. Instead, please fill out VA Form 28-0588 (VA Vocational Rehabilitation - Getting Ahead After You Get Out). [Download Form 28-0588](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-28-0588-ARE.pdf).

**Note:** Servicemembers going through the Physical Evaluation Board process, as well as Servicemembers who expect an other-than-dishonorable discharge and who have a VA memorandum rating of 20% or more, or are in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES), may qualify for VR&amp;E services.

</li>

<li class="step last eight">

After you apply, we'll schedule a meeting for you with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) to figure out if you have an employment handicap and if you qualify for VR&amp;E benefits and services. You have an employment handicap if your service-connected disability makes it hard for you to prepare for, find, and keep a job that suits your skills and needs. After we make an entitlement decision, you and your counselor will work together to create a rehabilitation plan. This plan outlines the rehabilitation and other services that VR&amp;E will provide.

</li>

</ol>
