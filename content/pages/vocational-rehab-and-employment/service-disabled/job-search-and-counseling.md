<div class="va-introtext">

If you want to follow a career path that uses your existing skill set, the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) program can help you with your job search through counseling and rehabilitation services that address your abilities, aptitudes, and interests. Find out if you can get VR&amp;E benefits to help you use your existing skill set to find a job.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I get employment counseling and job-search support through VR&amp;E?

You may be eligible for these benefits if you’re a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability and you:
- Have an employment handicap or barrier, **and**
- Are enrolled in VR&E, **and**
- Already have experience, education, or training in your field of interest

**Note:** Having an employment handicap means your service-connected disability limits your ability to  prepare for, find, and keep suitable employment (a job that doesn’t make your disability worse, is stable, and matches your abilities, aptitudes, and interests).

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

- Tools to help with your job search
- Career counseling
- Help with writing your resume and preparing for interviews
- Help determining if you’re eligible for Veterans’ Preference
