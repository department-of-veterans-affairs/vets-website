**Note for currently active Servicemembers:** If you have a disability and you're currently in predischarge status, filing a claim before you separate from the military may help to speed up the claim decision process. [Learn more about filing a predischarge claim](/disability-benefits/apply/claim-types/predischarge-claim/). 

Some dependents of Veterans with service-connected disabilities may also qualify for education and career counseling. [Learn about services for family members](/vocational-rehab-and-employment/family-members/).
