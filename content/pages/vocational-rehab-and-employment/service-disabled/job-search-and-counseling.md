<div class="va-introtext">

If you want to follow a career path that uses your existing skillset, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) can help you with your job search through counseling and rehabilitation services that address your interests and abilities. Find out if you can get VR&amp;E job-search counseling and employment coaching.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I get job-search counseling and employment coaching through VR&amp;E?

You may qualify for these benefits if you’re a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability and you have:
-	An employment barrier
-	Past experience, education, or training in your field of interest

**Note:** Having a service-connected disability means we’ve concluded that you were disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by your active military service. Having an employment barrier means that your disability makes it hard for you to prepare for, find, and keep a job that suits your skills and needs.

<br>

#### Who's covered?

- Veterans
- Servicemembers
- [Qualified family members](/vocational-rehab-and-employment/family-members/)

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

- A full assessment of your skills
- Help preparing for a new job
- Job search assistance
- Coaching after you’re employed

These services are in addition to our other employment search resources. [Learn about other VA employment resources](/employment/job-seekers/employment-support/).

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits to find a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) who can help you. [Apply for VR&amp;E](/vocational-rehab-and-employment/apply-vre/).

**Note for currently active Servicemembers:** If you have a disability and you're currently in predischarge status, filing a claim before you separte from the military may help to speed up the claim decision process. [Learn more about filing a predischarge claim](/disability-benefits/apply/claim-types/predischarge-claim/).
