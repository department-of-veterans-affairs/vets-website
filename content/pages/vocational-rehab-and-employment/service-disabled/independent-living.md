<div class="va-introtext">

If your service-connected disability limits your ability to perform activities of daily living (like bathing, dressing, accessing the community, and interacting with others), we may provide independent-living services. You may also receive these services as you work to find a job if that’s a goal you and your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) have created. In both cases, your counselor can help you restore your daily-living activities. Find out if you’re eligible for independent-living services.

### Can I get independent-living services through VR&amp;E?

You may be eligible for independent-living services if you’re a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability who qualifies for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) benefits, and:

- You have a service-connected disability rating of 20&#37; or higher, **and**
- Your injuries prevent you from looking for or returning to work right away, **and**
- Your case manager refers you after you enroll in the VR&amp;E program

<br>

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

Depending on your needs, services may include:
- Evaluation and counseling to figure out your needs and goals
- Home consultations with specialists
- Referral to support resources
- Guidance to help you understand if you’re eligible for our adaptive-housing programs. These programs can help you make changes to your home—like widening doorways or adding ramps—to help you live more independently. [Learn more about adaptive housing grants](/housing-assistance/adaptive-housing-grants/).

These services generally last up to 24 months. In some cases, services may be used for longer.

### How do I get these benefits?

First, you’ll need to apply for VR&amp;E benefits. Then, you’ll work with your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC). Follow these steps to apply:

<ol class="process">
<li class="step one">

[Log in to your eBenefits account](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage).

</li>

<li class="step two">

Choose **Additional Benefits** on your dashboard.

</li>

<li class="step three">

Choose **Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program**.

</li>

<li class="step four">

Apply for the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program. 

</li>

<li class="step five">

If you’re eligible, we’ll invite you to an orientation session at your nearest VA regional office.
</li>

<li class="step six">

If you’re eligible, a VRC will work with you to determine the severity of your service-connected disability, if you’re ready to work, and if you’ll benefit from independent-living services.

</li>

<li class="step last seven">

If you’re eligible, your VRC will help you create a personalized independent-living plan that meets your needs.

</li>
</ol>

**Note for currently active Servicemembers:** If you have a disability and you're currently in predischarge status, filing a claim before you separate from the military may help to speed up the claim decision process.
