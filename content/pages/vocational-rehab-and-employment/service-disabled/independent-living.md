<div class="va-introtext">

If your service-connected disability makes it hard for you to work and you need support to live more independently, you may qualify for independent-living services. You may also be able to get these services if you want to work toward greater independence as you look for a job. Find out if you can get help restoring your ability to take care of everyday tasks, like bathing, dressing, and getting around.

### Can I get independent-living services through VR&amp;E?

You may qualify for independent-living services if you qualify for Vocational Rehab and Employment (VR&amp;E) benefits, and:

- You have a service-connected disability rating of 20&#37; or higher, **and**
- Your injuries prevent you from looking for or returning to work right away, **and**
- Your case manager refers you after you sign up for the VR&amp;E program

**Note:** Having a service-connected disability means we've concluded that you were disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by your active military service. Your disability rating reflects how severe your disability is (with 0% being not at all disabled and 100% being totally disabled).

<br>

#### Who's covered?

- Veterans
- Servicemembers

</div>

### How do I get these benefits?

First, you’ll need to apply for VR&amp;E benefits. Then, you’ll work with your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC). Follow these steps:

<ol class="process">
<li class="step one">

[Apply for VR&amp;E benefits](/vocational-rehab-and-employment/apply-vre/).

</li>

<li class="step two">

We'll assign you a VRC. Your VRC will work with you to figure out the severity of your service-connected disability, if you're ready to work, and if you'll benefit from independent-living services.

</li>

<li class="step last three">

Your VRC will help you create a personal independent-living plan that meets your needs. Services may include:
- Evaluation and counseling to figure out your needs and goals
- Home consultations with specialists
- Referral to support resources
- Guidance to help you understand if you qualify for our adaptive-housing programs, which can help you make changes to your home—like widening doorways or adding ramps—to help you live more independently

Most qualified Servicemembers and Veterans get independent-living services for up to 24 months. In some cases, services may be used for longer than this period of time.

</li>
</ol>

**Note for currently active Servicemembers:** If you have a disability and you're currently in predischarge status, filing a claim before you separate from the military may help to speed up the claim decision process.
