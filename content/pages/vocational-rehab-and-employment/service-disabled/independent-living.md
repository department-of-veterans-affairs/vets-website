<div class="va-introtext">

If your service-connected disability limits your ability to perform activities of daily living (like bathing, dressing, accessing the community, and interacting with others), you may be able to get support to help you live more independently through the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) Independent Living Services track. You may also receive these services as you work to find a job if that’s a goal you and your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) have created. In both cases, your counselor can help you restore your daily-living activities. Find out if you’re eligible for independent-living services.

### Can I get independent-living services through VR&amp;E?

You may be eligible for independent-living services if you’re a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability who qualifies for VR&E benefits, and:

- You have a service-connected disability rating of 20&#37; or higher, **and**
- Your injuries prevent you from looking for or returning to work right away, **and**
- Your case manager refers you after you enroll in the VR&amp;E program

<br>

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

Depending on your needs, services may include:

- Evaluation and counseling to identify your needs and goals
- Home consultations with specialists
- Referral to support resources
- Guidance to help you understand if you’re eligible for our adaptive-housing programs. These programs can help you make changes to your home—like widening doorways or adding ramps—so you can live more independently. [Learn more about adaptive housing grants](/housing-assistance/adaptive-housing-grants/).

These services generally last up to 24 months. In some cases, you may be able to use services for longer than this.
