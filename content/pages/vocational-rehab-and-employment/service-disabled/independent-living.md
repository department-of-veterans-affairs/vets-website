<div class="va-introtext">

If your service-connected disability limits your ability to perform activities of daily living (like bathing, dressing, accessing the community, and interacting with others), you may qualify for independent-living services through the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) Independent Living track. You may also receive these services as you work to find a job if that’s a goal you and your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) have created. In both cases, your counselor can help you restore your daily-living activities. Find out if you may be eligible for services to help you live more independently.

### Can I get independent-living services through VR&amp;E?

You may be eligible for independent-living services if you’re a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability who is eligible for VR&E benefits, and:

- You have a service-connected disability rating of 20&#37; or higher, **and**
- Your injuries prevent you from looking for or returning to work, **and**
- Your case manager refers you after you enroll in the VR&amp;E program

<br>

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

Depending on your needs, services may include:

- Evaluation and counseling to identify your needs and goals
- Home consultations with specialists
- Referral to support resources
- Guidance to help you understand if you’re eligible for our adaptive-housing programs. These programs can help you make changes to your home—like widening doorways or adding ramps—so you can live more independently. [Learn more about adaptive housing grants](/housing-assistance/adaptive-housing-grants/).

These services generally last up to 24 months. In some cases, you may be able to use services for longer than this.
