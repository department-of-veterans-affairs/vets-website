<div class="va-introtext">

Do you have a service-connected disability that makes it hard for you to succeed in your career path? Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) training may help you find work in a different field that better suits your current abilities and interests. Find out if you’re eligible for VR&E benefits.

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I get career counseling and training for new skills through VR&amp;E?

You may be eligible for these benefits if you’re a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability (meaning we've concluded that you were disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by your active military service) and: 

- You have an employment barrier or handicap, **and**
- You're enrolled in VR&amp;E, **and**
- Your service-connected disability makes it hard for you to prepare for, find, and keep suitable employment (a job that doesn’t make your disability worse, is stable, and matches your abilities, aptitudes, and interests)

**Note:** You may be eligible for both VR&E training and GI Bill benefits. You'll need to decide which benefit you want to use. [Learn more about the GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/).

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

- A complete skills assessment
- Career guidance
- Job-market evaluation
- Education and training for a vocational field that’s a good fit for you
- Apprenticeship, on-the-job training, and volunteer opportunities 
- Employment help
