</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I get career counseling and new skills training through VR&amp;E?

You may qualify for these benefits if you’re a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability (meaning we've concluded that you were disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by your active military service), and: 

- You have an employment barrier or handicap, **and**
- You're signed up for VR&amp;E, **and**
- Your service-connected disability makes it hard for you to prepare for, get, and keep a job that suits your skills and needs

**Note:** You may qualify for both VR&E training and GI Bill benefits. You'll need to decide which benefit you want to use. [Learn more about the GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/).

<br>

#### Who's covered?

- Veterans
- Servicemembers
- [Qualified family members](/vocational-rehab-and-employment/family-members/)

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

- A full assessment of your skills
- Access to a career counselor
- Education or training for a vocational field that suits your skills and needs. This may include volunteer positions and on-the-job training.

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits to find a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) who can help you. [Apply for VR&amp;E](/vocational-rehab-and-employment/apply-vre/).

**Note:** VR&amp;E is an employment program different from the GI Bill that may be used to pay for education needed to train you for suitable employment.

**Note for currently active Servicemembers:** If you have a disability and you're currently in predischarge status, filing a claim before you separate from the military may help to speed up the claim decision process. [Learn more about filing a predischarge claim](/disability-benefits/apply/claim-types/predischarge-claim/).
