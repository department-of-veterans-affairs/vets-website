Do you have a service-connected disability that makes it hard for you to succeed in your career path? Find out if you're eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) training to help you find work in a different field that better suits your current abilities and interests.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I get career counseling and new skills training through VR&amp;E?

You may be eligible for these benefits if you’re a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability (meaning we've concluded that you were disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by your active military service), and: 

- You have an employment barrier or handicap (meaning your service-connected disability limits your ability to  prepare for, find, and keep a job that's consistent with your abilities, aptitudes, and interests), **and**
- You're enrolled in VR&amp;E, **and**
- Your service-connected disability makes it hard for you to prepare for, find, and keep suitable employment (a job that doesn’t make your disability worse, is stable, and matches your abilities, aptitudes, and interests)

**Note:** You may be eligible for both VR&E training and GI Bill benefits. You'll need to decide which benefit you want to use. [Learn more about the GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/).

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

- A comprehensive skills assessment
- Career guidance
- Job-market evaluation
- Education and training for a vocational field that’s a good fit for you
- Apprenticeship, on-the-job training, and volunteer opportunities 
- Employment help

**Note:** VR&amp;E is an employment program different from the GI Bill that may be used to pay for education needed to train you for suitable employment.

**Note for currently active Servicemembers:** If you have a disability and you're currently in predischarge status, filing a claim before you separate from the military may help to speed up the claim decision process. [Learn more about filing a predischarge claim](/disability-benefits/apply/claim-types/predischarge-claim/).
