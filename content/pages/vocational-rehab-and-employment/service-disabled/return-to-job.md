<div class="va-introtext">

If you're a Veteran with a service-connected disability, you can return to the job you held before deploying to active service because of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Find out if our Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) program can help you return to your old job by supporting your employer in meeting your needs. 

[Learn more about USERRA](http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/userra/).

### Can I get help returning to my old job through VR&amp;E?

You may qualify for help if you're a Veteran with a service-connected disability and you:
- Have an employment barrier or handicap, **and**
- Are signed up for VR&amp;E, **and**
- Would like to return to your previous place of employment

**Note:** Having a service-connected disability means we've concluded that you were disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by your active military service. Having an employment barrier means your disability makes it hard for you to prepare for, get, and keep a job that suits your skills and needs.

#### Who's covered?

Veterans

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get?

- A full range of rehabilitation services with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC)
- Referral to the Department of Labor to begin the process

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for these benefits to find a VRC who can help you. [Apply for VR&amp;E](/vocational-rehab-and-employment/apply-vre/).

**Note for currently active Servicemembers:** If you have a disability and you're currently in predischarge status, filing a claim before you separate from the military may help to speed up the claim decision process.
