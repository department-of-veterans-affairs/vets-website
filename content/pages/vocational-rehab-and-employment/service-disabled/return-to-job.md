<div class="va-introtext">

As a Veteran, you’re protected under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). This means you can’t be disadvantaged in your civilian career because of your service. If you’re a Veteran with a service-connected disability, we can help your employer accommodate your needs. Your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor can provide a full range of rehabilitation services, and can refer you directly to the Department of Labor to begin the process. Find out how we can help you return to your former job and support your employer in meeting your needs.

### Can I get help returning to my former job through VR&amp;E?

You may qualify for help if you're a Veteran with a service-connected disability and you:
- Have an employment barrier or handicap (meaning your service-connected disability limits your ability to  prepare for, find, and keep a job that's consistent with your abilities, aptitudes, and interests), **and**
- Are enrolled in Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E), **and**
- Would like to return to your previous place of employment
