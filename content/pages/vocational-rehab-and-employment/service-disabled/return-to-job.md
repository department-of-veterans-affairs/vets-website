Veterans with service-connected disabilities can return to the job they held before deploying to active service because of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). A service-connected disability means we've concluded that the Veteran was disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by their active military service. If you're a Veteran with a service-connected disability, find out if Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) can help you return to your old job by helping  your employer accommodate your needs.
