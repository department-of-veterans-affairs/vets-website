<div class="va-introtext">

If you're a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability and an employment barrier who has the strong desire, skills, and drive to run a successful business, you may be interested in the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) Self-Employment track. Find out if you can get help starting your own business.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I get help starting my own business through the VR&amp;E Self-Employment track?

You may be eligible for the VR&amp;E Self-Employment track if you're a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability of at least 20% and you:

- Have an employment barrier, **and**
- Are enrolled in VR&amp;E

You may also be entitled to services if you’re a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability of at least 10% and:
- You’re enrolled in VR&E, **and**
- A Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) says you need help because of a severe employment handicap
<br>
**Note:** Having an employment handicap means your service-connected disability limits your ability to  prepare for, get, and keep suitable employment (a job that doesn’t make your disability worse, is stable, and matches your abilities, aptitudes, and interests).

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get through the VR&amp;E Self-Employment track?

- Coordination services and help with developing a proposed business plan
- Analysis of your business concept
- Training in small-business operations, marketing, and finances
- Guidance in getting the right resources to implement your business plan

We may also provide minimum stocks, essential equipment, and business license fees for those with the most significant disabilities.

After you develop your business plan, we’ll review it and evaluate whether self-employment and the proposed business are viable options.
