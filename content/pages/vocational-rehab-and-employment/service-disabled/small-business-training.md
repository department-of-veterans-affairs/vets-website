<div class="va-introtext">

Are you a disabled Servicemember or Veteran who has the desire and skills to run a successful business? Find out if you can get counseling to guide you through the process of starting your own business through the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) self-employment track.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I get help starting my own business through the VR&amp;E self-employment track?

You may qualify for the VR&amp;E self-employment track if you're a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability of at least 20% and you have:
- An employment barrier, **and**
- A draft business plan

**Note:** Having a service-connected disability means we've concluded that you were disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by your active military service. Your disability rating measures how severe your disability is (with 0% meaning you're not at all disabled and 100% meaning you're totally disabled and not expected to improve). Having an employment barrier means your service-connected disability makes it hard for you to prepare for, get, and keep a job that suits your skills and needs.

<br>

#### Who's covered?

- Veterans
- Servicemembers

</div>

### What kind of benefits can I get through the VR&amp;E self-employment track?

- Coordination services and help with developing a proposed business plan
- Analysis of your business concept
- Training in small-business operations, marketing, and finances
- Guidance in getting the resources you'll need to put your business plan into action

We may also provide minimum stocks, needed equipment, and business license fees.

<hr>

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits to find a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) to help you. [Apply for VR&amp;E Benefits](/vocational-rehab-and-employment/apply-vre/).

If you qualify for VR&amp;E Benefits and develop a business plan, we'll review your plan and decide if self-employment and the proposed business are likely to succeed. If the answer is yes, we'll work with you to provide more support.

**Note for currently active Servicemembers:** If you have a disability and you're currently in predischarge status, filing a claim before you separate from the military may help to speed up the claim decision process. [Learn more about filing a predischarge claim](/disability-benefits/apply/claim-types/predischarge-claim/).
