If you have a service-connected disability (a disability that was caused by—or got worse because of—your active military service) that limits your ability to work or prevents you from working, our Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) program can help you— and, in some cases, your family members—explore career options and receive additional training.
