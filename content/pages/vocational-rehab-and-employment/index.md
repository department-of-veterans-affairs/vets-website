<div class="va-introtext">

If you have a service-connected disability that limits your ability to work or prevents you from working, the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) program can help you—and in some cases, your family members—explore career options and get more training if required. We sometimes refer to VR&E as Chapter 31.
