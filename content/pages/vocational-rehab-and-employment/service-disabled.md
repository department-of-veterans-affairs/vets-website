### Can I get VR&amp;E benefits?

##### Servicemembers

You may be eligible for VR&amp;E benefits if you're a Servicemember who:

- Has a 20% or higher predischarge disability rating (memorandum rating) and will soon leave the military, **or**
- Is participating in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) process or awaiting discharge due to a medical condition resulting from a serious injury or illness that occurred in the line of duty

**Note:** IDES helps to determine a Servicemember’s fitness for duty. It’s run in partnership by the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Veterans Affairs (VA). If you’re in the IDES and you’re found to be medically unfit for duty, you’ll get a proposed VA disability rating before you leave the service and you may be entitled to VR&E services. You’ll need to report for an evaluation with a VR&E before separating from active duty.

##### Veterans

You may be eligible for VR&amp;E benefits if you're a Veteran who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable, and you:
- Have a 10% or higher disability rating, **and**
- Separated from the military or received a service-connected disability rating from VA within the past 12 years

You may also be eligible for VR&amp;E benefits if you're a Veteran who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable, and you:
- Have a Serious Employment Handicap (SEH) due in large part to a service-connected disability, **and**
- Have a 10% disability rating, **or**
- Are beyond the 12-year basic period of eligibility
