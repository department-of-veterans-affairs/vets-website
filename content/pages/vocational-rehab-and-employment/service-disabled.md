If you're a Veteran or Servicemember with a service-connected disability that's stopping you from continuing on your current career path, our Vocational Rehab and Employment (VR&amp;E) program may help. Having a service-connected disability means we've concluded that you were disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by your active military service. We offer 5 different VR&amp;E program tracks to help you build your career and live more independently. Choose the track that best matches your needs.
