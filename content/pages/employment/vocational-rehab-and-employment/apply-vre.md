If you're a Servicemember or Veteran who’s overcoming challenges related to service-connected disabilities and an employment handicap, you can apply for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) benefits and services, also called Chapter 31. 

If you’re leaving active service soon, you can get free educational and career counseling services, also called Chapter 36. Find out how to apply online for these VR&amp;E benefits.

<div class="feature" markdown=“1”> 

### What if I'm applying for Chapter 31, and I haven't yet received a service-connected disability rating?

You don't need to wait for a rating. Instead, please fill out VA Form 28-0588 (VA Vocational Rehabilitation - Getting Ahead After You Get Out). [Download Form 28-0588](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-28-0588-ARE.pdf).

You may be eligible for VR&amp;E benefits and services if you're:
- Going through the Physical Evaluation Board process, **or**
- Expecting an other-than-dishonorable discharge and have a VA memorandum rating of 20% or more, **or**
- In the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES). [Learn more about accessing VR&E services through IDES](/employment/vocational-rehab-and-employment/ides).

**Please note:** Sec. 1631(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act (PL 110-181) established VR&E eligibility and automatic entitlement for severely injured active duty individuals before a VA rating is issued. Sec. 724 of Public Law 113-291 extends the sunset date of NDAA to September 30, 2018.

### What happens after I apply?

**For Vocational Rehabilitation:** We'll schedule a meeting for you with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) to determine if you have an employment handicap and if you're entitled to VR&amp;E benefits and services. You have an employment handicap if your service-connected disability limits your ability to prepare for, obtain, and maintain suitable employment (a job that doesn’t make your disability worse, is stable, and matches your abilities, aptitudes, and interests).

After we make an entitlement decision, you and your counselor will work together to develop a rehabilitation plan. This plan outlines the rehabilitation and other services that VR&amp;E will provide.

You can also meet with VRCs called VetSuccess on Campus (VSOC) Counselors at schools participating in the VetSuccess on Campus (VSOC) program. [Learn more about VetSuccess on Campus](/employment/vocational-rehab-and-employment/vetsuccess/).

**For Vocational Counseling:** If you’re eligible for vocational counseling, we’ll invite you to meet with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC). Your VRC will work with you to map out a career path.
