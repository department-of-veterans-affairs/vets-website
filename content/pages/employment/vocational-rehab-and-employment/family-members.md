As the dependent family member of a Servicemember or Veteran with a service-connected disability, you may have had to put your career and personal goals on hold because of the important support role you play. 

If the Servicemember or Veteran in your family is eligible to apply for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) benefits and services, you may be able to get career and educational counseling, and other support. Find out if you're eligible for certain benefits and services through VR&E or through other VA programs.
