<div class="va-introtext">

If you have a disability that was caused—or made worse—by your active-duty service and that limits your ability to work or prevents you from working, you may be eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) benefits and services. Find out if you can get employment support or help living as independently as possible.

### If I'm a Veteran, can I get VR&amp;E benefits and services?

You may be eligible for VR&amp;E benefits and services if you're a Veteran who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable and you:
- Have a 20% or higher disability rating, **and**
- Separated from the military or received a service-connected disability rating from VA within the past 12 years

You may also be eligible for VR&amp;E benefits and services if you're a Veteran who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable and you:
- Have a Serious Employment Handicap (SEH) due to significant impairments of your ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain employment, **and**
- Have a 10% disability rating, **or**
- Are beyond the 12-year basic period of eligibility

**Note:** Having a service-connected disability means we’ve concluded that you were disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by your active-duty service.

<br>

### If I'm still on active duty, can I get VR&amp;E benefits and services?

You may be eligible for VR&amp;E benefits and services if you're a Servicemember who:

- Has a 20% or higher predischarge disability rating (memorandum rating) and will soon leave the military, **or**
- Is participating in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) process or awaiting discharge due to a medical condition resulting from a serious injury or illness that occurred in the line of duty. [Learn more about accessing VR&E services through IDES](/employment/vocational-rehab-and-employment/ides/).

**Please note:** Sec. 1631(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act (PL 110-181) established VR&E eligibility and automatic entitlement for severely injured active duty individuals before a VA rating is issued. Sec. 724 of Public Law 113-291 extends the sunset date of NDAA to Dec. 31, 2018.
