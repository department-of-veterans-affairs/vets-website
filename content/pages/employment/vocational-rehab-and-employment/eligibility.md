<div class="va-introtext">

If you have a disability that was caused—or made worse—by your active-duty service and that limits your ability to work or prevents you from working, you may be eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) benefits and services, also called Chapter 31. Find out if you can get employment support or help living as independently as possible. 

If you’re leaving active service soon, find out how to get free educational and career counseling—also referred to as Chapter 36—to help you find a training program or a job.

### If I'm a Veteran, can I get Chapter 31 VR&amp;E benefits and services?

You may be eligible for VR&E benefits and services if you’re a Veteran, and you:

- Have received a discharge that is other than dishonorable, **and**
- Have a service-connected disability rating of at least 10% from VA, **and**
- [Apply for VR&E services](/employment/vocational-rehab-and-employment/apply-vre/)

**Basic period of eligibility**

Your basic period of eligibility ends 12 years from the date you received notice of your:
- Date of separation from active military service, **or**
- First VA service-connected disability rating

**Note:** The basic period of eligibility may be extended if a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) determines that you have a Serious Employment Handicap (SEH). Having an employment handicap means your service-connected disability limits your ability to prepare for, obtain, and maintain suitable employment (a job that doesn’t make your disability worse, is stable, and matches your abilities, aptitudes, and interests).

<br>

### If I'm still on active duty, can I get VR&amp;E benefits and services?

You may be eligible for VR&amp;E benefits and services if you're a Servicemember who:

- Has a 20% or higher pre-discharge disability rating (memorandum rating) and will soon leave the military, **or**
- Is participating in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) process or awaiting discharge due to a medical condition resulting from a serious injury or illness that occurred in the line of duty. [Learn more about accessing VR&E services through IDES](/employment/vocational-rehab-and-employment/ides/).

**Please note:** Sec. 1631(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act (PL 110-181) established VR&E eligibility and automatic entitlement for severely injured active duty individuals before a VA rating is issued. Sec. 724 of Public Law 113-291 extends the sunset date of NDAA to September 30, 2018.

### Can I get Chapter 36 educational and career counseling?

-	You were discharged from active duty not more than 1 year ago under conditions other than dishonorable, **and**
-	You qualify as a Veteran for educational assistance under a VA educational program. 

**Note:** Dependents who qualify for educational assistance may get these services under the following programs:

- [The Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program (DEA)](/education/gi-bill/survivors-dependent-assistance/dependents-education/)
