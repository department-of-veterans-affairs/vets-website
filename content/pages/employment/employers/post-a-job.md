### How it works

If your company’s current job listing is posted on the NLX, then it is also searchable in the Veterans Job Bank. If you haven’t registered your company with the NLX, [register now and post for free](https://us.jobs/postajobpartner.asp?partner=ebenefits).

### How to be a featured employer

Use the JobPosting Schema from schema.org.

If your job listing conforms to the JSON-LD template for schema.org’s JobPosting vocabulary, your job will automatically appear in the Veterans Job Bank within 24 hours of adding the job URL to the designated box in your VEC profile. When appropriate to a search query, your job will be returned as a featured listing near the top of the search results. Please note that the provided URL must end in .json and contain valid JSON-LD.

#### How the schema works

The schema.org JobPosting vocabulary consists of 18 basic elements (listed below). Each element describes a core detail of a job vacancy. Participation in the Veterans Job Bank requires only a handful of these elements (datePosted, hiringOrganization, JobLocation, SpecialCommitments, title, and url). Adding more elements, however, will make your job posting more accessible to searchers.

#### The schema.org JSON-LD JobPosting elements

Only those marked with an asterisk (*) are required for inclusion in the Veterans Job Bank. Square brackets [like this] following each element name indicate the schema.org data type.
