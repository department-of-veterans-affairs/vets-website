<div class="va-introtext">

Employers can set up an apprenticeship program that is approved for the GI Bill.

</div>

Employers provide Veterans with a job at an acceptable wage, as well as training, development, hands-on learning, and technical instruction. VA may give a stipend to Veterans. At the end of the program, Veterans receive job certification or journeyman status.

Submit a request through your [State Approving Agency (SAA)](http://www.nasaa-vetseducation.com/Contacts.aspx), which authorizes Registered Apprenticeship programs as approved for the GI Bill. This process typically takes less than 30 days.

The Department of Labor also has several [programs for Registered Apprenticeships](http://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/).
