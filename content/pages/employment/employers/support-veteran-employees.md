Veterans are civic assets who can draw on their experiences to improve your business. When a Servicemember first joins a private-sector company, there may be a transition period for both the Veteran and the company. This [web-based tutorial](http://www.va.gov/VETSINWORKPLACE/training/EAP/default.htm) provides tips on how you can support Veterans, Reservists, and National Guardsmen in your workplace.

If your company has not previously hired Veterans, learn about how you can design and implement a [Veterans hiring initiative](http://www.dol.gov/vets/ahaw/index.htm). A [Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR&E) Employment Coordinator](http://www.benefits.va.gov/VOCREHAB/docs/EmploymentCoordinators.xls) can help you if you are interested in hiring service-disabled Veterans. There may be [tax credits]( https://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/eligible.cfm#Veterans) of up to $9,600 for every eligible Veteran hired through the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which is administered by the Department of Labor.

In addition to the services listed above, VR&E provides employers with other benefits through the Special Employer Incentives (SEI) program. An employer hiring a Veteran with a service-connected disability who is approved for VR&E services may be entitled to reimbursements of up to 50% of the Veteranâ€™s salary for six months to offset training costs. Read about the [VR&E](http://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/index.asp) program or call 1-800-827-1000.

Employers participating in an on-the-job training (OJT) program can hire a Veteran at the apprenticeship wage and VA will supplement that wage with GI Bill payments. The training often results in permanent, full-time employment and provides employers with a well-trained Veteran employee.  

[Apprenticeship](/employment/employers/apprenticeship/) programs allow a Veteran to enter into a training contract for a specific period of time with an employer or union, and then at the end of the training period, the Veteran gains job certification or journeyman status.

Federal, state, or local government offices can set up a Non-paid Work Experience (NPWE) program to provide Veterans with internship opportunities. A [VR&E Employment Coordinator](http://www.benefits.va.gov/VOCREHAB/docs/EmploymentCoordinators.xls) can assist you if you are interested in setting up a NPWE program.

### Learn more about how to support your Veteran employees with disabilities:

- Some Veterans may have disabilities that were acquired or aggravated during their military service; these are called service-related or [service-connected disabilities](/disability-benefits/conditions/service-connected/).
- [Understanding Your Employment Rights Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): A Guide for Veterans](http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/ada_veterans.cfm) briefly explains how protections for Veterans with service-connected disabilities differ under USERRA and the ADA. It also describes how the ADA, in particular, applies to recruiting, hiring, and accommodating Veterans with service-connected disabilities.
