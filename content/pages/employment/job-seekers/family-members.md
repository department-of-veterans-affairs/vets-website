<div class="va-introtext">

The Veterans Employment Center can help spouses and other family members access valuable career resources.

</div>

Through the Department of Defense’s Spouse Education Career Opportunities (SECO) program, spouses can use government-sponsored career and education resources, take advantage of networking opportunities, and work with employment counselors. <br> [Learn more about SECO](https://myseco.militaryonesource.mil/Portal/). <br>
SECO also partners with other organizations that offer assistance for spouses interested in the following: 

- Connecting with employers committed to hiring military spouses.
- Pursuing additional education and/or training.
