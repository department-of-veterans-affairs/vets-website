<div class="va-introtext">

As a Veteran with a service-connected disability, there are many ways for you to pursue your personal and professional goals through both government and private-sector employment.

</div>

### Federal Job Preference

If you’re a Veteran with a service-connected disability, you qualify for hiring preference when competing for certain federal jobs. <br> [Learn more about applying for federal jobs](/employment/job-seekers/federal-employment/). <br> 
Some classifications, or exceptions, may qualify you for specific federal positions. Know which hiring exceptions you qualify for as a service-disabled Veteran. <br> [Check federal hiring authority information before applying](http://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/shav/).

**Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E)**
If you’re service disabled at more than 10% and can no longer continue your current employment due to injuries, you may be eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment. <br> [Find out more about Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E)](/employment/vocational-rehab-and-employment/).

**Start or Grow Your Own Business**
If entrepreneurship interests you, your disability may qualify you for preference in winning government contracts. <br> 
[Veteran entrepreneur programs can help you throughout this journey](/employment/job-seekers/register-your-business/).

### Private Sector

Private-sector employers may qualify for incentives such as tax benefits when hiring Veterans with service-connected disabilities. It is good for you to know about this when you meet with VA Employment Center representatives and during the interview process. <br>
[Learn more about tax benefits for hiring veterans](https://www.benefits.va.gov/VOW/docs/seiflyerfinal.pdf).

Credentialing and job training can help with your search. <br> [Check to make sure your military transcripts are accurate before you apply](/employment/job-seekers/military-transcripts/).
