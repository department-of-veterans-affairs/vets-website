<div class="va-introtext">

As you navigate the civilian marketplace, you may encounter challenges. The Veterans Employment Center can help.

</div>

More private-sector businesses are committing each day to hire Veterans and military family members. Review the latest [commitments](/employment/commitments) and search the [Veterans Job Bank](/employment/job-seekers/search-jobs) for new job openings. Or if you are considering pursuing [education, licensure, or certifications](/education/advanced-training-and-certifications/licensing-certification/), VA can help guide you through the process.

If you own your own business or want to start a company, VA, the [Small Business Administration Boots to Business program](https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/ovbd/resources/160511), and organizations like [Syracuse University’s Institute for Veterans and Military Families](http://vets.syr.edu/education/) offer mentorship, counseling, and training.

If you are out of work, you may be eligible for [unemployment support](http://careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx), which is handled by the state in which you work.
