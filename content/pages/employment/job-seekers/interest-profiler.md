You can use tools like <a href="http://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip"><span class="usa-sr-only">This will open a new website.</span>O&#42;Net Interest Profiler</a> to identify the kind of work you enjoy. After taking the short questionnaire, use the results (called an O&#42;Net code) in <a href="http://jobcenter.usa.gov/find-a-job"><span class="usa-sr-only">This will open a new website.</span>targeted job-search engines</a> that may ultimately help you identify a career that fits with the kind of work you enjoy.

Similarly, the <a href="https://va.careerscope.net/gibill"><span class="usa-sr-only">This will open a new website.</span>VA CareerScope Assessment Profile</a> provides a detailed report on interest areas such as humanitarian, mechanical, scientific, or artistic. This should be used in conjunction with your O&#42;Net results and shared with your career counselor. Together you may be able to more accurately target employment opportunities.

[My Next Move]( https://www.mynextmove.org/) has tasks, skills, salary information, and more for over 900 different careers. You can also get information about the O*Net Interest Profiler if you take the TAP programâ€™s Career Technical Training Track (CTTT).
