You can use tools like [O&#42;Net Interest Profiler](http://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip) to identify the kind of work you enjoy. After taking the short questionnaire, use the results (called an O&#42;Net code) in [targeted job-search engines](http://jobcenter.usa.gov/find-a-job) that may ultimately help you identify a career that fits with the kind of work you enjoy.

Similarly, the [VA CareerScope Assessment Profile](https://va.careerscope.net/gibill) provides a detailed report on interest areas such as humanitarian, mechanical, scientific, or artistic. This should be used in conjunction with your O&#42;Net results and shared with your career counselor. Together you may be able to more accurately target employment opportunities.

[My Next Move]( https://www.mynextmove.org/) has tasks, skills, salary information, and more for over 900 different careers. You can also get information about the O*Net Interest Profiler if you take the TAP program's Career Technical Training Track (CTTT).
