##### 12 Months Before Leaving Active Duty

- Fill in any gaps in your education or skill set by taking classes and obtaining certifications and licensures. The GI Bill may be used for some of this prior to exiting the service. <br> [Find out more about the GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/).
- Contact your local Transition Assistance Program (TAP) manager to schedule the mandatory Transition Goals, Plans, Success (GPS) curriculum. If you are unable to attend this training, it is available through Joint Knowledge Online, but you must have approval from your service branch to get credit. <br>
[Visit Joint Knowledge Online](https://jkodirect.jten.mil). <br>
You must complete the VA Benefits Briefings I and II, the Department of Labor Employment Workshop, and an Individual Transition Plan (ITP). ITPs are service branch specific. <br> [Check documents related to your branch](https://dodtap.mil/my.policy).

- Review military transcripts and service records for accuracy. <br>
[Check your military transcripts](/employment/job-seekers/military-transcripts/).
- Think about which industries and careers interest you, using tools such as o*Net and CareerScope. <br> 
[Use the Interest Profiler Tool](/employment/job-seekers/interest-profiler/). <br>
- Start developing a resume by translating military skills into equivalent civilian skills. <br>
[Use the military skills translator](/employment/job-seekers/skills-translator). <br>
[Import military skills using the Resume Builder](/employment/job-seekers/create-resume).
