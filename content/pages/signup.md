                <p>You need to verify your identity in order to protect your personal and health-related information.</p>
                <p>With your verified ID.me account you can use Vets.gov on your mobile phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use health tools, including refilling your VA prescription, sending messages to your healthcare team, and accessing your VA health record</li>
                  <li>Check the status of your claims and appeals</li>
                  <li>View Post-9/11 Bill enrollment information</li>
                  <li>Download VA letters related to your benefits and Veterans status</li>

                <p>
                  Because this type of information is personal and private, we work with our partners at ID.me to ensure Veterans are able to achieve the highest level of security that meets current industry standards for protecting data. This keeps your private information private by confirming that you are you — and not someone pretending to be you.
