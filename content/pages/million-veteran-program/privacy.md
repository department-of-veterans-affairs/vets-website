The Million Veteran Program (MVP) team is committed to protecting your personal information. We take privacy very seriously. Being a part of this program won’t affect your health care or VA benefits in any way.

## Who can access my information in MVP?

If you decide to be a part of MVP, researchers using the data will be able to see information from your VA medical records. But they won’t be able to see any information that could identify you (like your name, address, date of birth, or Social Security number).  

The MVP database uses a special code to store your information in order to protect your privacy. Select MVP staff members have access to these codes, but researchers don’t. They can’t see your information.

Researchers also use strict security processes so that only authorized personnel can access computers or areas with MVP information.

### If you have questions about privacy, you can:

-	Ask questions at your appointment.
-	Call 1-866-441-6075 to talk with an MVP specialist.

You can withdraw from the program at any time by calling 1-866-441-6075. You’ll need to fill out a withdrawal form, then VA will destroy your blood sample so that it can’t be used in future research.
