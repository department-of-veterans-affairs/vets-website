If you get VA health care at a [VA medical center with an MVP enrollment site](http://www.research.va.gov/MVP/all-clinics.cfm), VA will mail you a letter inviting you to be a part of MVP and asking you to schedule an appointment.
**Note:** Only Veterans already enrolled in VA health care can participate in MVP.

## If you haven’t gotten a letter, or would like to find out if you may enroll:

-	Call 1-866-441-6075 to make an appointment at your nearest MVP enrollment site.
-	[Go to an MVP enrollment site](http://www.research.va.gov/MVP/all-clinics.cfm). Call first to make sure it’s open when you want to come in: 1-866-441-6075. Please feel free to stop by an MVP enrollment site if you happen to be at a VA medical center already for another reason.

### What happens before my appointment?

Before your appointment, you’ll get a survey in the mail. Your answers will help researchers learn more about your health history, military experiences, and lifestyle. We ask you to fill out the survey and mail it back in the prepaid envelope.

### What happens during my appointment?

Your MVP appointment will take about 20 minutes. During this time, you will:

-	Sign forms to show that you agree to be a part of MVP and to give permission for your information to be used in the program’s research.
-	Give a small sample of your blood that researchers will use to study your genes.

### What happens after my appointment?

After your appointment, you’ll get a letter in the mail with an optional survey to fill out and return. If you didn’t get the first survey, or never sent it back, you’ll also get a copy of that one to fill out and return.

Researchers may use your blood sample and information in different research studies over many years. MVP won’t be able to tell you how researchers are using your sample or talk with you about your genetic information. But you may get updates about the program from time to time.


### Will MVP keep my information private?

Yes, MVP stores blood samples and health information without your name, address, date of birth, or Social Security number. Participating in MVP won’t affect your health care or VA benefits in any way.

### Can I withdraw from the program at any time?

Yes, you can withdraw any time by calling 1-866-441-6075. MVP will destroy your blood sample and remove your health information from the MVP database so researchers can’t use it in future research.
