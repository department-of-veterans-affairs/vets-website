Whether you're just getting out of the service or you've been a civilian for years now, our VA Welcome Kit can help guide you in how to access the benefits and services you've earned.

Based on where you are in life, your VA benefits and services can serve you in different ways. Keep your welcome kit handy to find out how we can support you at different times throughout your life—like when it’s time to go to school, get a job, buy a house, get health care, retiring, or making plans for your care as you age.

We also encourage you to share this guide with friends or family members who need help with their benefits.
