  - **[Toxic embedded fragments](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/toxic_fragments/index.asp):** Shrapnel and other metals (some containing chemicals) that stay in your body after an injury and can cause injury at the site of the fragment or in other parts of your body

### What should I do now?

Take these steps to make sure you’re taking care of your health:

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

Talk to your primary health care provider or your local VA environmental health coordinator about any health concerns related to your military service. [Find your local VA environmental health coordinator](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/coordinators.asp). 

- **If you have embedded fragments,** ask about getting an exam through the Toxic Embedded Fragment Surveillance Center. [Download our Toxic Embedded Fragments fact sheet](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/docs/exposures/TEFSC-veterans-fact-sheet.pdf).  

- **If you think you had contact with depleted uranium,** ask about getting screened through the Depleted Uranium Follow-up Program. [Learn more about the program](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/depleted_uranium/followup_program.asp).

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

Ask about getting a free exam and joining these registries to document your exposures and health concerns:
<br />
[The Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry](https://veteran.mobilehealth.va.gov/AHBurnPitRegistry/) 
<br />
[The Gulf War Registry](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/benefits/registry-exam.asp)
<br />
[The Ionizing Radiation Registry](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/radiation/benefits/registry-exam.asp)

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

Find out if you can get disability compensation (monthly payments) and other benefits if you have a health condition caused or made worse by your active-duty service. 
<br />
[See if you qualify for disability benefits due to Gulf War Illness](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/gulf-war-illness/).
<br />
[See if you qualify for disability benefits due to other service-connected conditions](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/).
