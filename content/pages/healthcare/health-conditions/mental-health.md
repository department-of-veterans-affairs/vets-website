### What mental health services does VA provide?

We provide mental health services such as:

- **Outpatient care** for Veterans with serious mental illness who have a lot of trouble functioning in daily life
- **Regular outpatient care**, which may include care provided over the phone, for Veterans facing a difficult time in their lives
- **Rehabilitation treatment and residential (live-in) programs** for Veterans with mental health problems and other needs (like those related to homelessness, job training, and education) who would be best helped by getting treatment or living in a structured setting for a period of time
- **Primary care** for many common mental and behavioral problems
- **Supported work settings** to help Veterans join the work force and live well in the community 

We also provide care to Veterans in crisis. This includes:

- **Emergency mental health care** 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, through VA medical centers and some local, non-VA hospitals
- **The Veterans Crisis Line**, which offers 24/7 support for Veterans in crisis and their families and friends

All mental health care at VA supports recovery. Our goal is to help you take charge of your treatment and live a full and meaningful life. Our providers also receive training about military culture, gender differences, and ethnic issues so that we can better understand each Veteran.

### How do I get mental health services through VA? 

The VA health care program covers mental health services. To get these services, first apply for VA health care. [Apply for health care](/healthcare/apply/).

Once you’re signed up: 

- **If you have a VA primary care provider,** talk to them about your mental health concerns. Your provider will offer support and treatment as needed, and can connect you with a mental health specialist (like a psychiatrist) for more support.
- **If you don’t have a VA primary care provider or have never been seen in a VA hospital or clinic:**
  - Call our general information hotline at <a href="tel:+1phonenumber">800-827-1000</a>, **or**
  - [Contact your local VA medical center](https://www.va.gov/health/vamc/).

### What if I don’t have VA health benefits? 

You may still be able to get care:

- **If you’ve served in a combat zone,** get free, confidential (private) counseling, alcohol and drug assessment, and other support at one of our 300 community Vet Centers. [Find a Vet Center near you](https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/vetcenter.asp). 
- **If you’re homeless or at risk of becoming homeless:** 
  - Visit our website to learn about VA programs for Veterans who are homeless. [Visit www.va.gov/homeless](https://www.va.gov/homeless/).
  - Contact the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans at 877-4AID-VET (<a href="tel:+1phonenumber">877-424-3838</a>) anytime day or night. A trained VA counselor will offer information about VA homeless programs, health care, and other services in your area. The call is free and confidential (private).
  - Call or visit your local VA Community  Resource and Referral Center. Even if you don’t qualify for VA health care, our staff can help you find non-VA resources you may qualify for in your community. [Find your local Community Resource and Referral Center]( https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/Crrc.asp).

**Please note:** If you don’t qualify for VA health care, you may still be able to get certain health care services (like care for issues linked to military sexual trauma). Call our general VA hotline at <a href="tel:+1phonenumber">800-827-1000</a> to find out what your care options may be.
