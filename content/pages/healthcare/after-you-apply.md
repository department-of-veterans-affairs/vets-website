<div class="va-introtext">

After you apply for VA health care, we’ll send you a letter in the mail to let you know if your application’s been approved. 

</div>

### How long does it take VA to make a decision?

<div class="card information" markdown="0">
<span class="number">Less than 1 week</span>
<span class="description">If more than a week has passed since you gave us your application and you haven’t heard back, please don’t apply again. Call <a href="tel:+18555747286">855-574-7286</a>.</span>
</div>

### What should I do if I disagree with your decision on my claim? 

If your application isn’t approved and you disagree with the decision, you can file an appeal. We’ll send you a letter that explains why we didn't approve your application. This letter includes directions on how to appeal the decision if you don’t agree with it.
