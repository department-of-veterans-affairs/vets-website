After you’ve applied for VA health care, we’ll send you a letter in the mail to let you know if your application’s been approved. Find out what happens next.

### How long does it take VA to make a decision?

<div class="card information" markdown="0">
<span class="number">Less than 1 week</span>
<span class="description">If more than a week has passed since you gave us your application and you haven’t heard back, please don’t apply again. Call <a href="tel:+18555747286">855-574-7286</a>.</span>
</div>

### If my application is approved, what do I do next?

<ol class="process">
<li class="step one">

#### Wait for your welcome call from VA

We’ll call you to welcome you to the VA health care program, help you with scheduling your first doctor’s appointment, and answer any questions you may have about your health care benefits.

</li>

<li class="step two">

#### Read your Veterans Health Benefits Handbook

We’ll send this to you by mail. Your handbook will explain your specific health care benefits (based on your enrollment priority group assignment) and how much you’ll pay in copays as well other helpful information.

[Download a sample handbook](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhbh/publications/vhbh_sample_handbook_2014.pdf). 

[Learn more about priority groups](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/resources/priority_groups.asp). 

</li>

<li class="step three">

#### Get your Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC)

This is the card you’ll use for ID and to check in at your VA health care appointments. To get your card, contact your local VA medical center and ask for the enrollment coordinator. Ask the coordinator to help you arrange to have your picture taken for your new VHIC. Or, you can request your VHIC at your next VA health care appointment. 

[Learn more about the VHIC](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/vhic/index.asp).

[Connect with your local VA medical center](https://www.va.gov/health/vamc/). 

</li>

<li class="step last four">

#### Go to your first VA doctor’s appointment

You may have requested a doctor’s appointment when you applied (either in person or on your application). If you did, we’ll make you an appointment with a VA doctor or provider and send you a notice with your appointment time in the mail. If you didn’t ask for a doctor’s appointment when you applied, we’ll help you set up your appointment during your welcome call.

#### What if I need to see a doctor before my scheduled appointment?

If you need to see a doctor before your scheduled appointment, contact your local VA medical center or clinic. [Find VA location near you](/facilities). When you call, ask for:
- The enrollment coordinator, or
- The urgent care clinic, or
- The emergency room

</li>
</ol>

### What should I do if my application isn’t approved and I disagree with the decision? 

If your application isn’t approved and you disagree with the decision, you can file an appeal. We’ll send you a letter with the reason why we didn't approve your application. This letter will also include directions on how to appeal the decision if you don’t agree with it.
