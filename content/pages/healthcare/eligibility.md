### Can I get VA health care benefits? 

You may be able to get VA health care benefits if you served on active duty and separated under conditions other than dishonorable. 

You should know:

- **If you enlisted after September 7, 1980, or entered active duty after October 16, 1981,** you must have served 24 continuous months or the full period for which you were called to active duty. This minimum duty requirement may not apply if you:

  - Were discharged for a disability that was caused—or made worse by—your active-duty service, **or**
  - Were discharged for a hardship or "early out," **or**
  - Served prior to September 7, 1980

- **If you're a current or former member of the Reserves or National Guard,** you must have been called to active duty by a federal order and completed the full period for which you were called or ordered to active duty. If you had or have active-duty status for training purposes only, you don't qualify for VA health care.

- **If you separated under conditions other than honorable, there are 2 things you can do:**

  - You can use VA’s Health Benefits Explorer to find out if any exceptions apply to you. [Go to the Health Benefits Explorer](http://hbexplorer.vacloud.us/).
  - Or, you can visit healthcare.gov to find out if you qualify for health insurance. [Go to healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/).

#### Enhanced Eligibility Status

You may qualify for enhanced eligibility status (meaning you'll be placed in a higher priority group, which makes you more likely to get benefits) if at least 1 of these applies to you:

- You receive financial compensation (payments) from VA for a service-connected disability
- You were discharged for a disability resulting from something that happened to you in the line of duty
- You were discharged for a disability that got worse in the line of duty
- You’re a recently discharged Combat Veteran
- You get a VA pension
- You’re a former Prisoner of War (POW)
- You’ve received a Purple Heart
- You get (or qualify for) Medicaid benefits
- You served in Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975
- You served in Southwest Asia during the Gulf War between August 2, 1990, and November 11, 1998
- You served at least 30 days at Camp Lejeune between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987

If none of the above apply to you, you may still qualify for care based on your income. Learn more about how the amount of money your family makes can affect whether you qualify for VA benefits. [Learn more about income limits](http://nationalincomelimits.vaftl.us/).

<span id="priority-groups">

#### What are priority groups and how do they affect me? 

When you apply for VA health care, you’ll be assigned 1 of 8 priority groups. This system helps to make sure that Veterans who need immediate care can get signed up quickly.

Your priority group may affect how soon we sign you up for health care benefits. It may also affect how much (if anything) you’ll have to pay toward the cost of your care. [Learn more about health benefit copay rates](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/cost/copay_rates.asp). 

Your priority group will be based on:

- Your military service history, **and**
- Your disability rating, **and**
- Your income level, **and**
- Whether or not you qualify for Medicaid, **and**
- Other benefits you may be receiving (like pension benefits)

We assign Veterans with service-connected disabilities the highest priority. We assign the lowest priority to Veterans who earn a higher income and who don’t have any service-connected disabilities qualifying them for disability compensation (monthly payments).

#### I have other health insurance (like Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance). Does that affect whether I can get VA health care benefits? 

No. Whether or not you have health insurance coverage doesn't affect the VA health care benefits you can get. [Learn more about how VA works with other insurance](/healthcare/about-va-health-care/va-health-care-and-other-insurance/).
