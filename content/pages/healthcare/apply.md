### Are you eligible for VA health care?

If you served on active duty, and separated under conditions other than dishonorable, you may qualify for VA health care.

If you separated under a dishonorable discharge, visit [healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) to find out if you qualify for health insurance.

#### If at least one of the following applies to you, you probably qualify for VA health care:

- You receive financial compensation (pay) from VA for a service-connected disability.
- You were discharged for a disability that happened or was made worse in the line of duty.
- You are a recently discharged Combat Veteran.
- You receive a VA pension.
- You are a former Prisoner of War.
- You have received a Purple Heart.
- You receive (or are eligible for) Medicaid benefits.
- You served in Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975.
- You served in Southwest Asia during the Gulf War between August 2, 1990, and November 11, 1998.
- You served at least 30 days at Camp Lejeune between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987.

If none of the above apply to you, you may still qualify for care based on your income. Learn more about how the amount of money your family makes ([income threshold](http://nationalincomelimits.vaftl.us/)) can affect your eligibility for VA benefits.
