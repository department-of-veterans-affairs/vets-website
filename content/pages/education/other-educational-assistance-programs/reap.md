REAP ended on November 25, 2015, but under the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016, some REAP benefits will remain in place for 3 more years. [Learn more about what this change means for you](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/reap.asp).

</div>

The Post-9/11 GI Bill has replaced REAP, providing educational assistance benefits for Reserve and National Guard members called to active duty on or after September 11, 2001. [Learn more about the Post 9/11 GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/)

If you applied for REAP on or after November 25, 2015, your application will be reviewed and appropriate benefits will be applied, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill. If you'd like to stop using REAP and use the Post-9/11 GI Bill instead, call <a href="tel:+1phonenumber">888-442-4551</a> (888-GI-BILL-1) from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (CT) Monday through Friday.
