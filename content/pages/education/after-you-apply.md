The transition from military to civilian life can be challenging. We offer tools and counseling programs to help you make the most of your educational options. [Learn about education and career couseling](/education/tools-programs/education-career-counseling/).

### What happens after I apply?

You’ll get a Certificate of Eligibility (COE), or award letter, in the mail if we've approved your application. Bring this to the VA certifying official at your school.

You can also start looking at future careers and job opportunities. [Learn about career-development resources](/employment/).
