<h3 style="padding:0">30 days</h3>
<p style="padding:0">This is the average time it takes to process education claims.</p>

</div>

### What should I do while I wait?

The transition from military to civilian life can be challenging. We offer tools and counseling programs to help you make the most of your educational options. [Learn about education and career couseling](/education/tools-programs/education-career-counseling/).

### What happens after I apply?

Youâ€™ll get a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) or Award Letter in the mail if your application was approved. Bring this to the VA certifying official at your school.

You can also start looking at future careers and job opportunities. [Learn about career-development resources](/employment/).
