You may be able to get help paying for some of your costs—like books, tuition, and housing—if you’re part of a co-op. Find out if you can get these education benefits.

### How much will I get if I join a co-op training program?

The amount we cover depends on the benefit you use. [View current payment rates](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp).

- **The Post-9/11 GI Bill:** If the program is at a public IHL, we pay the actual costs for public in-state tuition and fees. If the program is at a private or foreign IHL, we pay the lesser of the national maximum or the actual costs for in-state tuition and fees. We also pay for some of the cost of housing and books.
- **All other GI Bill programs:** We pay a monthly rate that depends on which GI Bill program you qualify for.
