Co-op training means you can go to school and earn experience in your field, like computer programming, at the same time. If you're enrolled at an approved Institution of Higher Learning (IHL) and you're part of a co-op training program, VA may still cover some costs.

### How do I get these benefits?

The amount VA covers depends on the benefit you use.

- **The Post-9/11 GI Bill:** If the program is at a public Institute for Higher Learning (IHL), VA pays the actual costs for public in-state tuition and fees. If the program is at a private or foreign IHL, VA pays the lesser of the national maximum or the actual costs for in-state tuition and fees. Housing and books stipend benefits are also paid.
- **All other GI Bill programs:** VA pays a monthly rate that varies depending on which GI Bill program you're entitled to use.
