### How do I get these benefits? 

You’ll need to make sure the program is approved for VA education benefits. [Check with your local VA office](/facilities). 

You’ll most likely need to enter into a training contract for a set amount of time with an employer or union. During training, you’ll probably get a salary from the employer or union, which can go up as you gain more skills. When you finish your training, you’ll get a job certification or journeyman status.

If you’re a Veteran in an approved program, you can use your GI Bill benefit and get tax-free money for books and supplies. The Post-9/11 GI Bill offers you a monthly housing allowance (MHA) in addition to your entry-level wage. We issue GI Bill payments each month after your employer or union reports your hours to us.

Your payment depends on which GI Bill program you’re using. [View the payment rates](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp).

#### Post-9/11 GI Bill MHA Payment Rates
You’ll get 100% of your applicable MHA during the first 6 months of training. Then you’ll get:

- 80% of your applicable MHA during the second 6 months of training
- 60% of your applicable MHA during the third 6 months of training
- 40% of your applicable MHA during the fourth 6 months of training
- 20% of your applicable MHA during the rest of the training period

#### All other GI Bill Programs Payment Rates

- 75% of the full-time GI Bill rate for the first 6 months of training
- 55% of the full-time GI Bill rate for the second 6 months of training
- 35% of the full-time GI Bill rate for the rest of the training period
