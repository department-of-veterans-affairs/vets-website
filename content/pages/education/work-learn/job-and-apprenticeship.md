### How do I get these benefits? 

You'll need to make sure the program is approved by a State Approving Agency (SAA). [Check with your local VA office](/facilities). 

You'll most likely need to enter into a training contract for a specific amount of time with an employer or union. During training you'll probably get a salary from the employer or union, which typically goes up as you gain more skills. At the end of your training period, you'll get a job certification or journeyman status.

Veterans in an approved program can use their GI Bill benefit and get a tax-free stipend. The Post-9/11 GI Bill pays a monthly housing allowance (MHA), which is paid in addition to the entry-level wage. VA issues GI Bill payments each month after getting verification of your hours from your employer or union.

Your payment will depend on the which GI Bill program you're using. [View the payment rates](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp).

#### Post-9/11 GI Bill MHA Payment Rates
You will receive 100% of your applicable MHA during the first six months of training in these increments:

- 80% of your applicable MHA during the second 6 months of training
- 60% of your applicable MHA during the third 6 months of training
- 40% of your applicable MHA during the fourth 6 months of training
- 20% of your applicable MHA during the remainder of the training

#### All other GI Bill Programs Payment Rates

- 75% of the full-time GI Bill rate for the first 6 months of training
- 55% of the full-time GI Bill rate for the second 6 months of training
- 35% of the full-time GI Bill rate for the remainder of the training program
