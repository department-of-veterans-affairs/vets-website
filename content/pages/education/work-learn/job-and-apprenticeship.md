### How it works

Participation in these programs generally involves entering into a training contract for a specific amount of time with an employer or union. During training you will likely receive a salary from the employer or union, which typically increases as you gain more skills. At the end of your training period, you will get a job certification or journeyman status.

Veterans in an approved program can use their GI Bill benefit and receive a tax-free stipend. The Post-9/11 GI Bill pays a monthly housing allowance (MHA), which is paid in addition to the entry-level wage. Take a look at the [On-the-Job &amp; Apprenticeship Training Programs fact sheet](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/docs/factsheets/OJT_Factsheet.pdf) for more information.

VA issues GI Bill payments each month after receiving verification of your hours from your employer or union.

Your payment varies depending on the GI Bill program. View the [payment rates](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp) for your GI Bill program.

#### Post-9/11 GI Bill MHA Payment Rates
You will receive 100% of your applicable MHA during the first six months of training in these increments:

- 80% of your applicable MHA during the second six months of training
- 60% of your applicable MHA during the third six months of training
- 40% of your applicable MHA during the fourth six months of training
- 20% of your applicable MHA during the remainder of the training

You will receive up to $83 per month for books and supplies.

#### All other GI Bill Programs Payment Rates

- 75% of the full-time GI Bill rate for the first six months of training
- 55% of the full-time GI Bill rate for the second six months of training
- 35% of the full-time GI Bill rate for the remainder of the training program

**Exception:** OJT is not available if you are an active-duty Servicemember, and it is not available to spouses using a transferred benefit.
