<div class="va-introtext">

If you’re enrolled in a high-tech program and intend to work in a high-tech industry, you may be eligible to receive a lump-sum payment of 60% of tuition and fees. VA issues accelerated payment to you instead of the monthly benefits you would otherwise receive. This program covers the higher per-month costs associated with these courses of study.
