### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for benefits. The amount you get depends on which GI Bill program you use and which school you go to. We pay you at the end of each month for the hours you have spent training, and we give you a monthly housing allowance based on the location of the school. [Apply for education benefits](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/). 

**Post-9/11 GI Bill:** For training offered at non-degree schools, we pay the in-state tuition and fees up to the national maximum. 

**Other GI Bill programs:** We pay a monthly rate that depends on your specific program and your length of active service.
