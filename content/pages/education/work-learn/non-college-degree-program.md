### How it works

Benefits depend on which GI Bill program you use and the school you attend. VA pays you at the end of each month for the hours you have spent training, and provides a monthly housing allowance based on the location of the school. You may receive up to $83 per month for books and supplies.

Post-9/11 GI Bill: For training offered at non-degree schools, VA pays for in-state tuition and fees up to the [national maximum](http://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp).

Other GI Bill programs: VA pays a monthly rate that depends on your specific program and your length of active service. View [current payment rates](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp).
