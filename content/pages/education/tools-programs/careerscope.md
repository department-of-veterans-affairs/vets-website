Besides career counseling, we give you access to CareerScope, a tool that measures your interests and skill levels. Veterans use CareerScope to help figure out the best career path when moving into civilian life. [Use the CareerScope Tool](https://va.careerscope.net/gibill).

CareerScope uses your results and gives you recommendations that help identify which career areas you may enjoy and in which jobs you might do well. CareerScope also recommends courses or training programs that can help you go after those careers.

The Report Interpretation guide helps you understand your CareerScope results. [Use the guide](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/docs/job_aids/CareerScope_Report_Interpretation.pdf).
