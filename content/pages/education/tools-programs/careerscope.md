In addition to career counseling through VA, you have access to CareerScope, an interest and aptitude assessment tool. Veterans, Servicemembers and dependents can use CareerScope to figure out what civilian career path to take. [Use the CareerScope Tool](https://va.careerscope.net/gibill). 

After you answer some questions, CareerScope will give you recommendations that help identify which career fields you may enjoy and in which careers you might do well. CareerScope also recommends courses or training programs that can help you pursue those careers.

Use this [Report Interpretation guide](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/docs/job_aids/CareerScope_Report_Interpretation.pdf) to help you understand your CareerScope results.
