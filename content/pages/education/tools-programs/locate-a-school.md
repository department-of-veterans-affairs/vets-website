Not all schools and vocational institutions are eligible for use with VA benefits. Use the [school search tool](http://inquiry.vba.va.gov/weamspub/buildSearchInstitutionCriteria.do;jsessionid=qtMbSxQFpzyL7GpnQrtnNGv6G9CGQQvb2YqM9Cvw3vB2pv2lXhfJ!-1531379871) to find out which schools or training facilities are approved for use with VA education benefits. You can also find institutions of higher education participating in the [Yellow Ribbon Program](/education/gi-bill/yellow-ribbon/), which can help pay for school costs not covered by VA. 

[Use the GI Bill Comparison Tool](https://vets.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool/). The GI Bill Comparison tool helps you see what benefits you'll get at different schools.
