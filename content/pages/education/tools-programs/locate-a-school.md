<div class="va-introtext">

Not all schools and vocational institutions are eligible for use with VA benefits. Use the [school search tool](http://inquiry.vba.va.gov/weamspub/buildSearchInstitutionCriteria.do;jsessionid=qtMbSxQFpzyL7GpnQrtnNGv6G9CGQQvb2YqM9Cvw3vB2pv2lXhfJ!-1531379871) to locate institutions that are approved for use with VA education benefits. You can also locate institutions of higher education participating in the [Yellow Ribbon Program](/education/gi-bill/yellow-ribbon/), which may offer additional education-related costs not covered by VA.

Use the [GI Bill Comparison Tool](/gi-bill-comparison-tool/).
