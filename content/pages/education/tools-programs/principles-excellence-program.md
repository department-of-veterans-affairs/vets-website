The Principles of Excellence program requires schools that get federal funding through programs such as the GI Bill to follow certain guidelines. Learn about these guidelines.
</div>

<br>
Schools that are a part of the program must:

- Give you a written personal summary of the total cost of your educational program, including:
  - The costs covered by your benefits.
  - The financial aid you may qualify for.
  - Your expected student-loan debt after you graduate.
  - Other information to help you compare aid packages offered by different schools.
- Give you an educational plan with a timeline showing how and when you can fulfill everything required for you to graduate.
- Assign you a point of contact who will give you ongoing academic and financial advice (including access to disability counseling).
- Allow for you to be gone for both long and short periods of time due to service obligations (service you must fulfill) for active-duty Servicemembers and Reservists.
- Make sure all new programs are accredited (officially approved) before enrolling students.
- Make sure their refund policies follow Title IV rules, which guide federal student financial aid programs.
- End fraudulent (deceitful) and aggressive methods of recruiting.

Schools that don't charge tuition and fees don't have to follow the Principles of Excellence guidelines. These include:

- Foreign schools
- High schools
- On-the-job training and apprenticeship programs
- Residency and internship programs

Use the GI Bill Comparison Tool to learn which schools are part of the program. You can also compare benefits offered by different schools. [Use the GI Bill Comparison Tool](/gi-bill-comparison-tool/).
