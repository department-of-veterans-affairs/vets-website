The Principles of Excellence program are guidelines for schools getting federal funding, like through the GI Bill.  Schools that are a part of the program must:

- Provide a personalized form to help you understand the total cost of your educational program, including:
  - Costs covered by your benefits.
  - Financial aid you may qualify for.
  - Your estimated student-loan debt upon graduation.
  - Other information to help you compare aid packages offered by different schools.
- Provide an educational plan with a completion timeline that shows how and when you can fulfill the requirements for graduation.
- Designate a point of contact to provide you with ongoing academic and financial advice (including access to disability counseling).
- Accommodate both long and short absences due to service obligations for active-duty Servicemembers and Reservists.
- Ensure accreditation of all new programs before enrolling students.
- Align their refund policies with those under Title IV, which governs the administration of federal student financial aid programs.
- End fraudulent and aggressive recruiting techniques and misrepresentations.

Institutions that don't charge tuition and fees don't have to comply with the Principles of Excellence. This includes:

- Foreign schools
- High schools
- On-the-job training and apprenticeship programs
- Residency and internship programs

Use the [GI Bill Comparison Tool](https://vets.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool/) to learn which schools are part of the program. You can also compare beneifts between different schools.
