<h3 itemprop="name">How do you decide what my payments will be?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

We decide your payment amounts based on the number of classes you go to and the hours spent in those classes. For example, for most undergraduate degrees, a college considers:

-	12 or more hours full time
-	Between 9 and 11 hours three-quarter time
-	Between 6 and 8 hours half time
-	Less than 6 hours reimbursable at a rate that’s no more than the tuition and fees charged for the course

<h3 itemprop="name">How much does VA cover for graduate-level programs?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

The school decides how to rate each hour. For example, if a graduate program at your school considers a 2-hour class full time, we’ll pay you the full-time rate.

<h3 itemprop="name">Can I take classes at more than one school at a time?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You can take classes at more than one school under the GI Bill as long as:
- The classes at both schools count toward your degree, **and**
- The school granting your degree considers the classes at the second school to be required in order to get your degree

**Note:** The GI Bill won’t pay you to take the same class twice unless you get a failing grade in a class that the school requires for graduation.

<h3 itemprop="name">Can I use the GI Bill to pay for classes toward more than one degree?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

Yes. After earning your first degree, you can use any GI Bill benefits you have left over to pay for classes for another degree.

<h3 itemprop="name">How does VA make the payments?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

We issue payments after each month’s classes. For example, you’ll get the payment for November classes in December.

For the Post-9/11 GI Bill, we pay:
- Tuition and fees directly to the school
- Money for books to you at the beginning of the term
- Housing allowance to you at the end of each month
