### How it works
You may receive benefits for up to eight semesters (four years) of traditional academic education. The benefits, paid monthly, depend upon the following factors:

- college-fund eligibility
- your contribution to the $600 Buy-Up program

#### Several related funding or training programs fall under the MGIB-AD umbrella:

- [$600 Buy-Up program](/education/gi-bill/buy-up-program/): While on active duty, you can contribute a maximum of $600 to receive increased monthly benefits. With this maximum contribution, you are eligible for up to an additional $5,400 in GI Bill benefits.
