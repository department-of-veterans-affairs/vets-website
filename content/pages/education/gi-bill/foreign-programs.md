### Can I get VA education benefits to study at a foreign school?
You can get education benefits if you qualify for—or already get—VA educational assistance and you meet both of the requirements listed below.

**Both of these must be true:**
  - We’ve approved your program, **and**
  - Your program is at an institution of higher learning where you’ll earn a standard college degree or something of equal value at that foreign school

### Who’s covered?

- Veterans
- Qualified dependents

**Exception:** Family members who qualify for Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance can get VA benefits while in approved postsecondary (after high school) non-college degree programs at training locations in the Philippines.

</div>

### What benefits can I get?

- Money for school
- Money for your housing costs during enrollment

-----

### Is the application process different for foreign schools?

Yes. The application process is different. Here’s what you’ll need to do:

- Contact the school or use the GI Bill Comparison Tool to find out if we’ve approved your program for VA educational benefits. <br>
[Use the GI Bill Comparison Tool](/gi-bill-comparison-tool/).
- If you still have questions about the school or program, you can submit a question to us using the GI Bill website. <br>
[Go to the GI Bill website](https://gibill.custhelp.com/app/utils/login_form/redirect/ask).
- Then, give us the name of the foreign school, the complete address, and the name of the program you want to enroll in. We’ll let you know if your program has already been approved.

If you or your qualified dependent want to enroll in a program that we haven’t approved, you’ll need to ask the school to request approval. We can’t take any action until an official from your school (not you) requests approval. If we don’t approve your program, you’ll have to pay all costs at the school, including tuition and fees.

### Can I attend any foreign school?

- We’ll accept degrees from schools in foreign countries that are similar to degrees granted by U.S. colleges and universities that are accredited (meaning approved and recognized according to certain standards).
- For private schools overseas, the degree must be of equal value to those granted by public colleges and universities in the same country, and the school must have the same entrance requirements.
- Independent study courses must be accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting association.

Use the GI Bill Comparison Tool to see what benefits you can get at the school you want to attend.

**Exception:** Programs at schools located in the United States that offer courses in a foreign country through the Department of Defense don’t qualify as foreign training. Also, year abroad and similar programs offered by schools in the United States don’t qualify as foreign training.


### How do I get these benefits?


<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

After we approve the school, you’ll need to apply. <br>
[Apply for benefits](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/).

Turn in your application to us at least 90 days before you leave for your new school. We’ll decide what benefits you get based on your school’s location.

If you get approved for benefits, turn in your Certificate of Eligibility (COE) to the school’s certifying official to show that you qualify for VA benefits. Your school’s certifying official will submit your enrollment information with a VA Enrollment Certification (VA Form 22-1999). Please note that you won’t get payments until we’ve received and processed your enrollment information.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

Be sure you have enough money to cover all your needs until VA payments begin. And make arrangements with the school for acceptance, enrollment, payment of tuition and fees, and housing.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

Make sure you give written permission for school officials to release necessary information to us. If you don’t, it could affect when you get benefits.

Normally, foreign schools certify their students for 1 academic year. Within 120 days of your enrollment, you should let the school know if you plan to re-enroll and ask the certifying official to submit an enrollment certification for you. Make sure the school knows your plans for continued enrollment to avoid any delay in getting your benefits.
