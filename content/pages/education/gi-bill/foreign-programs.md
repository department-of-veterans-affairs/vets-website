Contact the school or [Submit a Question](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/ext_redirect.asp?url=https://gibill.custhelp.com/app/ask/) to learn if your program is approved for benefits. Provide the name of the foreign school, the complete address, and the name of the program you intend to pursue. We'll let you know whether your program has already been approved. Allow for extra time if you are applying to a program that we haven't approved.

We'll accept degrees from schools or establishments in foreign countries that are similar to degrees granted by accredited U.S. colleges and universities. If you're considering getting a degree or its equivalent from a private institution overseas, the degree must be comparable to those granted by public colleges and universities in the same country. In addition, programs at private institutions must have the same entrance requirements as programs offered by public colleges and universities in the same country. Independent study (distance learning) courses must be accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting association.

**Exception:** Programs at schools located in the United States that offer courses in a foreign country under contract with the Department of Defense are not considered foreign training. Likewise, year abroad and similar programs offered by schools in the United States aren't considered foreign training.

You'll need to apply. [Apply for benefits](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/). Turn in your application to us at least 90 days before your departure. Make sure you send your application to the appropriate regional office for the fastest service. Your benefit will be processed depending on your school’s location. 

If you're approved, turn in your Certificate of Eligibility (COE) to the school’s certifying official as verification that you are eligible to receive VA benefits. Your school’s certifying official will submit your enrollment information on VA Form 22-1999. Please note that you won't receive payments until your enrollment information has been received and processed by VA.

-	If you or your eligible dependent wants to enroll in a program that we haven't approved, you'll need to ask the school to request approval. We can't take any action until a request for approval is received from a school official (not from you). If your program is not approved, you'll be responsible for all costs at the school, including tuition and fees.
-	School officials should [follow these instructions](http://benefits.va.gov/gibill/foreign_program_approval_information_for_schools.asp) when applying for approval of education programs.

You must provide written permission for school officials to release information as necessary to us. If you don't, it could affect when you get benefits. 

Normally, foreign schools certify their students for 1 academic year. If you want to continue your education at the foreign school for longer than 1 academic year, you may have to reapply. Within 120 days of your reenrollment, you should notify the school of your intention to reenroll and have the appropriate certifying official submit an enrollment certification for your reenrollment. You should keep the school advised of your plans for continuing enrollment in order to avoid any delay in getting your benefits.
