If you're on active duty and plan to use the the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) or Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP), you can increase your GI Bill monthly payments through the GI Bill buy-up program, sometimes called a kicker. Keep in mind that The National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 ended REAP on November 25, 2015. [Be sure and check to see if you can still get REAP benefits](https://www.vets.gov/education/other-educational-assistance-programs/reap/). 

### How do I get this benefit? 

-Decide how much extra you want to contribute. With a $600 contribution, you can get up to $5,400 more in GI Bill benefits. [This table](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rates/600_buyup.asp) shows how much your payments will be. 
-Fill out [Form DD-2366](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/forms/eforms/dd2366-1.pdf) and take it to your payroll or personnel office. 
-Keep copies of the Form and any other paperwork that shows you made the payment. 

**Note:** This program is can't be used with the Post 9/11 GI Bill.
