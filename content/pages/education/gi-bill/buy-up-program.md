If you participate in the $600 Montgomery GI Bill Buy-Up program, your GI Bill monthly payments will increase.

### How it works

Some Servicemembers may contribute up to an additional $600 to the GI Bill to receive increased monthly benefits. With a $600 contribution, you can receive up to $5,400 more in GI Bill benefits. The additional contribution must be made while on active duty. View the increased monthly rates and contact your personnel or payroll office.

[This table](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rates/600_buyup.asp) shows the amount of increase you can expect.

**Note:** This program is intended for use with the Montgomery GI Bill or REAP and cannot be used with any other program.
