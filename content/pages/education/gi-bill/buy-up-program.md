### How do I get this benefit? 

- Decide how much extra you want to contribute. With a $600 contribution, you can get up to $5,400 more in GI Bill benefits. [View the rate table](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rates/600_buyup.asp). 
- Fill out Form DD-2366 (Increased Benefit Contribution Program) and take it to your payroll or personnel office. [Get Form DD-2366](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/forms/eforms/dd2366-1.pdf).
- Keep copies of the form and any other paperwork that shows you made the payment. 

**Note:** This program can't be used with the Post 9/11 GI Bill.
