If your school participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program, you may be able to reduce or eliminate your education costs that are not covered by the [Post-9/11 GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/index.html), such as higher tuition at private colleges or out-of-state schools.

### Are you eligible for benefits?
Yes, if:

  - You are a Veteran or the dependent of a Veteran who is eligible for transfer of entitlement for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, or you are the child of an active-duty Servicemember who is the recipient of a transfer of entitlement.
  - You are eligible to receive 100% Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. [Is this me?](https://gibill.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/947)

### How it works

<ol class="process">
<li class="step one">
<div markdown="1">

##### Submit application
After you submit your application for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits and VA finds you eligible, you will receive a Certificate of Eligibility.
</div>
</li>

<li class="step two">
<div markdown="1">

##### Bring certificate
Bring this certificate to your participating institution’s financial aid, military liaison, or other office as determined by your school, and ask to apply to your school’s Yellow Ribbon Program.

</li>

<li class="step three">
<div markdown="1">

##### Receive determination

###### Your school will determine:
  -  Whether it has already enrolled the maximum number of participants for the program period. Enrollment is on a first-come, first-served basis. Your school and VA agree on how many students may be covered each year.
  -  What the amount of entitlement will be. This is calculated by adding up tuition and mandatory fees, and then subtracting any specific aid you’ve received from other sources such as scholarships or grants as well as your Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition payment. Your school applies the Yellow Ribbon Program benefit to this final amount.
