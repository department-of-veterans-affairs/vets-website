You can get education benefits if:

-------

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply. [Apply for education benefits](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/). 

The benefit amount depends on which school you go to, how much active-duty service you've had since September 10, 2001, and how many credits or training hours you're taking.

#### What benefits does the Post-9/11 GI Bill include? 

- The full tuition amount for in-state schools up to the maximum national average of $22,805.34
- A Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) based on the cost of living where your school is located
- Up to 36 months of education benefits, in most cases payable for 15 years after your release from active duty
- A percentage-of-maximum-benefit scale based on how much active service you've had since September 10, 2001

**Example:** If you had 90 days of active service since September 10, 2001, you would qualify for 40% of the maximum amount. Three years of active service would qualify you for 100% of the benefit.

#### Other possible benefits

- You may be able to get money through the Yellow Ribbon Program to cover higher private-school and out-of-state tuition and fees. [Learn about the Yellow Ribbon Program](/education/gi-bill/yellow-ribbon/).
- If you're a qualified Servicemember, you can transfer all 36 months or a portion of your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to a spouse or child. The Department of Defense approves a transfer of benefits. [Learn about transferring Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits](/education/gi-bill/transfer/).
