<h3 itemprop="name">Can I get education benefits?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You can get education benefits if: 
- You qualify for any GI Bill program, **and** 
- You’ve served on active duty for at least 90 days—with or without a break in service—after September 10, 2001.

If you qualify for more than one VA education benefit, you’ll have to pick which one you want to use. This is an irrevocable decision, meaning you can’t change your mind.

<h3 itemprop="name">Does this benefit expire?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits expire 15 years after your last separation date from active service. You must use all of your benefit by that time or you’ll lose whatever’s left.

**If your service ended after January 1, 2013:** There’s no time limit for using your education benefits (known as a “delimiting date”). But our automated system still prints letters with outdated information about end dates. Any delimiting date that’s on your records right now isn’t correct, but it’ll remain until we update our system. [Learn more about this and other new provisions from Forever GI Bill - Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act.](https://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/ForeverGIBill.asp)

<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You’ll need to apply. [Apply for education benefits](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/). 

The benefit amount depends on which school you go to, how much active-duty service you’ve had since September 10, 2001, and how many credits or training hours you’re taking.

<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

- The full tuition amount for in-state schools up to the maximum national average of $22,805.34
- A Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) based on the cost of living where your school is located
- Up to 36 months of education benefits, in most cases payable for 15 years after your release from active duty

**Example:** If you had 90 days of active service since September 10, 2001, you would qualify for 40% of the maximum amount. Three years of active service would qualify you for 100% of the benefit.
