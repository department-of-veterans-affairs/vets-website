If you are the dependent of a Veteran who has died or who was permanently and totally disabled while on active duty or due to a service-related condition, you may qualify for 45 months of college or graduate degree, certificate courses, apprenticeship, and on-the-job training under the Survivors' and Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA) program.

###Can I get education benefits?

**You can get benefits if you are the child or spouse of:**

- A Veteran who died or who is permanently and totally disabled as the result of active service.
- A Veteran who was permanently and totally disabled as the result of active service and who died while in this condition.
- A Servicemember hospitalized or receiving outpatient treatment for a service-connected permanent and total disability who is likely to be discharged for that disability.
- A Servicemember missing in action or captured in the line of duty by a hostile force.
- A Servicemember forcibly detained or interned in the line of duty by a foreign entity.

**If you are the child of the Veteran or Servicemember, you can get benefits if:**

- You are between the ages of 18 and 26, except in special circumstances.
- You can be married or unmarried.

If you are over 18 years old and using DEA, you can't get [Dependency Indemnity Compensation (DIC](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/types-dependency_and_indemnity.asp) from VA. 

If you join the military, you can't use this benefit while on active duty, and you must not be discharged under dishonorable conditions. Military service can extend your eligibility but this increase generally doesn't go past your 31st birthday.

**If you are the spouse of the Veteran or Servicemember:**

- Your benefits start on the date VA finds you eligible or on the date of the Veteran’s death, and last for 10 years.
- If the Veteran was rated permanently and totally disabled, with an effective date that’s 3 years after discharge, you'll be eligible for 20 years from that effective date. This new policy began on October 10, 2008, and no benefits will be paid for training you started before October 10, 2008.
- If the Servicemember died on active duty, your benefits end 20 years from the date of death.
- You can get DIC payments from VA and use DEA benefits.

###Who's covered?
Eligible dependents of Veterans

### What benefits can I get? 

A monthly payment of up to $1,021. [View current rates](http://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/resources/benefits_resources/rates/ch35/ch35rates100115.asp).

For both children and spouses, if you're eligible for both DEA and the [Fry Scholarship](/education/gi-bill/survivors-dependent-assistance/fry-scholarship/), you must pick one or the other. Once you make this choice, you can't change it.

**Exception:** If you are the child of a Servicemember who died in the line of duty before August 1, 2011, you can use both DEA and the Fry Scholarship. That means you can get up to 81 months of education and training.
