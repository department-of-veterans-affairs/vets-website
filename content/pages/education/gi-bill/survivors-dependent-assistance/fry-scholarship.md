### Available benefits

Fry Scholarship (GI Bill benefits)

-----

### How it works

Children are eligible as of their 18th birthday or after graduating high school, whichever comes first. Childrens’ eligibility ends on their 33rd birthday. A spouse has 15 years from the Servicemember’s death to use the benefit.

If you are a dependent and your parent died in the line of duty before August 1, 2011, you may be eligible for both the Fry Scholarship and the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance [(DEA)](/education/gi-bill/survivors-dependent-assistance/dependents-education/) program, but you can use only one program at a time. Combined benefits are capped at 81 months of full-time training.

Surviving spouses are eligible to receive [Dependency and Indemnity Compensation](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/types-dependency_and_indemnity.asp) (DIC) while using the Fry Scholarship. Children over 18 who receive DIC benefits will need to give up those payments when they start to use the Fry Scholarship.

**Exception:**
Spouses who remarry will lose their eligibility for this benefit.
