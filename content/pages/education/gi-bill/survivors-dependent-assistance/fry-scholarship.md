### Can I get Fry Scholarship benefits?
You may be able to get benefits under the Fry Scholarship if you're the child or surviving spouse of an active-duty Servicemember who died in the line of duty on or after September 11, 2001.

### Who's covered?
- Qualified dependents
- Qualified spouses
</div>

### What benefits can I get? 
You may be able to get up to 36 months of benefits, including:
- Money for tuition (full in-state tuition costs at public schools and up to $22,805.34 per year for training at private or out-of-state schools)
- Money for housing
- Money for books and supplies


-----

### Do I qualify for these benefits? 

- Children qualify as of their 18th birthday or after graduating high school, whichever comes first. Children no longer qualify as of their 33rd birthday. A spouse has 15 years from the Servicememberâ€™s death to use the benefit.

**Note:** A new provision of the law extends benefit eligibility to January 1, 2021, for spouses of Servicemembers who died in the line of duty between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2005.

- If you're a dependent and your parent died in the line of duty before August 1, 2011, you may qualify for both the Fry Scholarship and the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program. But you can use only 1 program at a time. We cap combined benefits at 81 months of full-time training. [Read about the DEA program](/education/gi-bill/survivors-dependent-assistance/dependents-education/).

- Surviving spouses qualify to get Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) while using the Fry Scholarship. Children over age 18 who get DIC benefits have to give up those payments when they start to use the Fry Scholarship. [Read about DIC](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/types-dependency_and_indemnity.asp).

**Exception:**<br>
Spouses who remarry can't get the Fry Scholarship.

##### Choose a school

<li class="process-step list-two">

##### Apply for benefits

- Fill out VA Form 22-5490 (Dependents' Application for VA Education Benefits) and send it to the VA regional office where you want to go to school. [Download VA Form 22-5490](http://www.va.gov/vaforms/form_detail.asp?FormNo=22-5490).

They'll need to submit it online using VA Online Certification (VA-ONCE).
