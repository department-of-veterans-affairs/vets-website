The Yellow Ribbon Program can help you pay for higher out-of-state, private, or graduate school tuition that the [Post-9/11 GI Bill](/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/) doesn't cover.

### Can I use the Yellow Ribbon Program?
You can use the Yellow Ribbon Program if:

  - You qualify for the [maximum benefit rate under the Post-9/11 GI Bill](https://www.vets.gov/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/).

  - You served an combined period of 36 months on active duty after September 10, 2001.
  - You were honorably discharged from active duty for a service-connected disability with at least 30 continuous days after September 10, 2001.
  - You're the dependent of a Veteran eligible for [transfer of entitlement for the Post-9/11 GI Bill](https://www.vets.gov/education/gi-bill/transfer/).

### How it works

<ol class="process">
<li class="step one">

##### Apply for GI Bill benefits
If you apply and qualify for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, you'll get a Certificate of Eligibility (COE).

##### Apply for the Yellow Ribbon Program
Bring your COE to your school's VA certifying official, financial aid or military liaison office, and ask to apply to the Yellow Ribbon Program. Each school decides how many students will get Yellow Ribbon benefits, and it's on a first-come, first-serve basis. That means you should apply for the program as soon as you get your COE. Your school will tell you if you were accepted.

##### Follow up
Check back with your school's VA certifying official who will turn in your enrollment information to VA. That person should also work with VA to make sure the Yellow Ribbon Funds are put toward the tuition costs.
