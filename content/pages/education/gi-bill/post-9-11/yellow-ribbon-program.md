The Yellow Ribbon Program can help you pay for higher out-of-state, private, or graduate school tuition that the Post-9/11 GI Bill doesn’t cover. Find out if your school is a part of this program.

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Can I get this benefit?
You can get this benefit if:

 - You qualify for the maximum benefit rate under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, **and**
 - Your school takes part in the Yellow Ribbon Program and has confirmed your enrollment with us.

You may be able to get this benefit if you’re the dependent of a Veteran who qualifies for a Transfer of Entitlement (TOE) for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. [Find out about transferring Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits](/education/gi-bill/transfer/).

### How do I get this benefit?

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

<div markdown="1">

##### Apply for GI Bill benefits
If you apply and qualify for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, you'll get a Certificate of Eligibility (COE). [Apply for benefits](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/).

<li class="process-step list-two">
<div markdown="1">

##### Apply for the Yellow Ribbon Program
Bring your COE to your school's VA certifying official, financial aid or military liaison office, and ask to apply to the Yellow Ribbon Program. Each school decides how many students will get Yellow Ribbon benefits, and it's on a first-come, first-serve basis. That means you should apply for the program as soon as you get your COE. Your school will tell you if you were accepted.

##### Follow up
Check back with your school's VA certifying official who will turn in your enrollment information to VA. That person should also work with us to make sure the Yellow Ribbon Funds are put toward the tuition costs.
