<div class="va-introtext">

If you’re a Guardsman, Reservist, or Veteran who doesn’t qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you can apply for education benefits through these other programs:
- [The post-Vietnam Era Veterans’ Educational Assistance Program](/education/other-educational-assistance-programs/veap/) (VEAP, Chapter 32)
- [The Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty](/education/gi-bill/montgomery-active-duty/) (MGIB-AD, Chapter 30)
- [The Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserve](/education/gi-bill/montgomery-selected-reserve/) (MGIB-SR, Chapter 1606)
- [The National Call to Service program](/education/other-educational-assistance-programs/call-to-service/)

An accredited representative (a trained professional trusted to help with VA-related claims) who works with a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) can help you pick the right program. [Get help from an accredited representative](/disability-benefits/apply/help/index.html).
