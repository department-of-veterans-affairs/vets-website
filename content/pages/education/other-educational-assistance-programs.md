- [The post-Vietnam Era Veterans’ Educational Assistance Program](/education/other-educational-assistance-programs/veap/) (VEAP, Chapter 32)
- [The Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty](/education/gi-bill/montgomery-active-duty/) (MGIB-AD, Chapter 30)
- [The Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserve](/education/gi-bill/montgomery-selected-reserve/) (MGIB-SR, Chapter 1606)
- [The National Call to Service program](/education/other-educational-assistance-programs/call-to-service/)
