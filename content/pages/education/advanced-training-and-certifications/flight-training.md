### Who's covered?

Veterans who qualify for any of the GI Bill programs

</div>

### What benefits can I get? 

**Under the Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD) or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP)**, we'll pay you back for part of flight training costs at an approved pilot school.<br>
[Learn about MGIB-AD](/education/gi-bill/montgomery-active-duty/).<br>
[Learn about REAP](/education/other-educational-assistance-programs/reap/).

**Under the Post-9/11 GI Bill**, we'll pay the pilot school the full cost of your flight training, up to a yearly limit (based on your level of eligibility). If flight training is part of your college degree at an approved college or university, we'll cover the tuition and fees, a monthly housing allowance, and the cost of books and supplies. If you're enrolled in a vocational flight training program, we'll pay you back the lesser of the full cost of training or the annual maximum amount of training.<br>

### How do I get these benefits? 

You'll need to apply for benefits. [Apply for education benefits](/education/apply-for-education-benefits/).

The benefits depend on the benefit program you use:

**If you use MGIB or REAP**, we'll pay you back for 60% of the approved fees. [Get more information about payments](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp).

**If you use the Post-9/11 GI Bill**, your payment depends on what flight course you take and what type of school you go to.

- If your school is a public college or university, we'll pay back the school for the full cost of tuition and fees.*
