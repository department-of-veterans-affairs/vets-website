### Can I get benefits for flight training if I have remaining entitlement under the GI Bill?

You can get benefits for flight training if you:
- Have at least a private pilot’s license.
- Have at least a second-class medical certificate valid for second-class privileges—or a first-class medical certificate if you want to pursue the Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate.

### Who's covered?

Anyone who qualifies for any of the GI Bill programs. <br />
**Exception:** You aren't covered if you're using Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA).
