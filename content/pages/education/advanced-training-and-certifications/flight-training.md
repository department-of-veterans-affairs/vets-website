<div class="va-introtext">

If you want to pursue a career in the aviation industry as a pilot, VA offers benefits to help you achieve your goal.

</div>


<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Are you eligible to receive benefits for vocational flight training and have remaining entitlement under the GI Bill?

Yes, if:

- You have at least a private pilot’s license.
- You have at least a second-class medical certificate valid for second-class privileges—or a first-class medical certificate if you want to pursue the Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate.

### Who is covered

Anyone eligible under any of the GI Bill programs except for Dependents’ Educational Assistance (Chapter 35)
</div>

### Available benefits
Under all eligible chapters except the Post-9/11 GI Bill, we reimburse you for a portion of the costs of flight training at an approved pilot school.

Under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, we pay the pilot school the full cost of your flight training, up to a yearly limit (in proportion to your level of eligibility). If flight training is part of your college degree at an approved college or university, we pay the cost of required tuition and fees as well as a monthly housing allowance and a books-and-supplies stipend.

### How it works

#### Flight training is available for the following licenses and ratings (this list is not all inclusive):

Commercial pilot, instrument rating, certified flight instructor (airplane, instrument, multi-engine), multi-engine rating, flight engineer certification, fixed wing and rotorcraft.

#### The requirements and benefits vary according to the benefit program you use:

- If you use the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) or the [Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP)](/education/other-educational-assistance-programs/reap/), VA reimburses eligible beneficiaries for 60% of the approved charges. View [payment information](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp).
- If you use the Post-9/11 GI Bill, your payment varies depending on the specific flight course and what type of school you're attending.
    - If your school is a standalone Part 141 pilot school, VA pays the school the full cost of training up to a yearly limit*. See the [annual maximum amount](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp).
    - If your school is a public college or university, VA reimburses the school the full cost of tuition and fees*.
    - If your school is a private college or university, VA reimburses the school the full cost of tuition and fees up to a yearly limit*.

*All payments limited by your level of eligibility and remaining entitlement.
