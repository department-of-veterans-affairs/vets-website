We provide education benefits to qualifying Veterans and their family members. The amount of money you’ll get for things like books, tuition, and housing depends on which program you choose.

Use our rate tables to see how much money you’ll get. [View the Rate Tables](http://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp#ch33).
