We provide education benefits to qualifying Veterans and their family members. The amount of money you’ll get for things like books, tuition, and housing depends on which program you choose. 
</div>

Use our rate tables to see how much money you’ll get. [View the Rate Tables](http://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp#ch33).

Use the GI Bill Comparison Tool to compare estimated benefits by school. [Go to the GI Bill Comparison Tool](/gi-bill-comparison-tool/).
