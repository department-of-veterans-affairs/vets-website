VA provides education benefits to qualifying Veterans and their family members. The amount of money you'll get for things like books, tuition, and housing, depends on which program you choose. You can see how much you'll get using the Rate Table. [View the Rate Tables](http://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp#ch33).  Use [the GI Bill Comparison tool](/gi-bill-comparison-tool/) to compare estimated benefits by school.
