                        <p>Vets.gov is an official, secure VA government website, built and maintained by U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs employees and contractors under the direction of the VA Office of the Secretary. As with all VA websites, we follow strict security policies and practices to make sure that your personal information is safe and protected.</p>
                        <p>When you sign in to Vets.gov, we'll protect your personal information by using the strongest identity verification system available to prevent fraud and identity theft. We’ll also give you the option to set up an extra layer of security (called 2-factor authentication) on your account. This helps to make sure that no one but you can access your account—even if they get your password.</p>
                        <p>We’ve built Vets.gov to help you better access our agency’s vast digital system—so you can easily find, apply for, track, and use the benefits and services you’ve earned. We test all site content and tools with Veterans and make changes based on their feedback. We welcome your feedback too. <a href="#feedback-tool" onclick="document.getElementById('feedback-tool').click()">Provide feedback on Vets.gov</a>.</p>

You’ll need to provide your Social Security number and either upload pictures of your ID card (your driver's license or passport) or answer questions based on your public and private data (like your credit report) that only you'd know how to answer.</p>
                        <p>You can then use this login to securely access your VA benefits and personal health information online. You can also use your ID.me online dashboard to monitor activity linked to your ID.me account and to change what information is shared with Vets.gov.</p>

                        <p>There are 2 levels of access for Vets.gov.</p>
                        <h4>Basic Access</h4>
                        <p>You can start by signing in with just your email address and a password that you've chosen. With this level of access, you can do things like save your online applications as you work on them and come back to finish filling them out later.</p>
                        <h4>Expanded access once you’ve verified your identity</h4>
                        <p>If you want to use more advanced Vets.gov tools to manage your benefits and services—like tracking your VA claims and appeals, downloading your full VA health record, or tracking how much of your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits you've used—you'll need to take extra steps to verify your identity. This means we’ll make sure you’re you (not someone pretending to be you) before we give you access to your personal information.</p>
                        <p>To get started, you’ll create an account through ID.me, our trusted technology partner in helping to keep your personal information safe.</p>
                        <p>Or, you can sign in with your <strong>My Health<em>e</em>Vet</strong> or <strong>DS Logon</strong> account (used to access eBenefits or milConnect)—and we'll connect your account to Vets.gov through ID.me. If you have a basic or advanced (non-premium) account, you’ll need to verify your identity through ID.me. We can also help you use ID.me to add an extra layer of security to your account (called 2-factor authentication).</p>

                        <p>A <strong>DS Logon</strong> account is a U.S. government-owned secure ID that gives you a single username and password to sign in to many different VA and Department of Defense (DoD) websites and apps. These include Vets.gov and other sites you can use to manage your benefits and services, like eBenefits, the TRICARE&reg; patient portal, and milconnect.</p> 
                        <p>With a basic <strong>DS Logon</strong> account, you can access some features of these sites. But you'll need a premium account to view your personal information in VA and DoD systems or to use any apps that connect to your VA health record.</p>
                        <p>With a premium account, you can do things like:</p>

                        <p>Follow these 2 steps to sign up for a <strong>DS Logon</strong> account.</p>
                        <p><strong>1. First, make sure you're enrolled in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).</strong> This is the database that records all the people who are eligible for military benefits.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>If you're a Veteran or Servicemember or qualified family caregiver, survivor, or dependent of a Veteran or Servicemember who's served since 1982,</strong> you should already be enrolled in DEERS.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you're a Veteran or the qualified family caregiver, survivor, or dependent of a Veteran who served before 1982,</strong> you may not be enrolled. To enroll, call us at 1-800-827-1000 and choose "Option 7." Tell the operator you need to be enrolled in DEERS and ask for an email confirming when enrollment is complete.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>2. Then, register for your basic DS Logon account online.</strong></p>
                        <p>Go to the DS Logon self-service site and click on the button labeled "More DS Logon Options." From the choices that appear, select "Need a DS Logon?"</p>
                        <p>You'll then be asked to select your registration method:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>If you have a Common Access Card (CAC) with accessible card reader,</strong> choose this option. It's the easiest way to get a DS Logon account and upgrade to a premium account right away.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you have a Defense Finance and Account Service (DFAS) myPay account,</strong> you can select this option. You'll be able to upgrade to a premium account right away.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you don't have a CAC or DFAS myPay account,</strong> select the "None of the above conditions apply" option.</li>
                        </ul>
                           <p>The registration tool will direct you on how to sign up for your account and will prompt you to upgrade to a premium account through an online proofing process. Through this process, you'll be asked a series of questions to prove you're you—and not someone pretending to be you—to help protect the personal information you'll have access to with a premium account.</p>

                        <p>You can verify your identity in 1 of 3 ways:</p>
                        <h4>Online</h4>
                        <p>To get started, log in to your account at the DS Logon Access Center and choose the upgrade option.</p>

                          <li><strong>If you have a CAC or DFAS myPay account</strong>, eBenefits will use that to verify your identity.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you don’t have a CAC or DFAS myPay account</strong>, you can upgrade by going through an online remote proofing process. You’ll be asked a series of questions to verify your identity.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you’re the qualified dependent of a Veteran or Servicemember</strong>, you can try to complete the online remote proofing process. If it doesn’t work, your sponsoring Veteran or Servicemember can log in to their DS Logon account using their CAC or DFAS myPay account and request a premium account for you.

                        <p>Yes. If we find that your credit is frozen while we’re trying to verify your identity, we’ll give you a link to an Experian page that offers you a free single-use personal identification number (PIN). This PIN will let you give us one-time access to the credit information we need to verify your identity.</p>
                        <p>Your credit freeze will stay active. Verifying your identity doesn’t affect your credit score.</p>

                        <p>There may be different reasons why you can’t verify your identity with ID.me. You may be inputting information (like your date of birth) or answering questions in a way that doesn’t match the records ID.me uses to confirm your identity. Or, there may be another error that’s happening when you try to complete the process.</p>
                        <p>You can:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Try using your driver’s license or passport to verify your identity. Be sure to follow the image guidelines when you upload a copy of your driver’s license or passport.</li>
                          <li>Try answering the personal security questions again, following these tips:</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Pull a copy of your credit report from Experian and use it to double check that the answers you’re providing to ID.me during the proofing process matches the information in your report.<br/>

                            <li> If you think your credit report has the wrong information, you’ll need to file a dispute with Experian.<br/>

                            <li>If you’ve recently moved, changed names, or have a different permanent address, try using your previous information.</li>
                            <li>Make sure you’re entering a phone number that’s registered in your name.</li>
