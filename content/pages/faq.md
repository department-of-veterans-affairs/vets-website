                        <p>Follow these 2 steps to sign up for a premium <strong>DS Logon</strong> account.</p>
                        <p><strong>1. First, make sure you’re enrolled in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).</strong> This is the database that records all the people who are eligible for military benefits.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>If you’re a Veteran or Servicemember or qualified family caregiver, survivor, or dependent of a Veteran or Servicemember who served after 1982,</strong> you should already be enrolled in DEERS.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you’re a Veteran or the qualified family caregiver, survivor, or dependent of a Veteran who served before 1982,</strong> you may not be enrolled. To enroll, call us at <a href="tel:+1phonenumber">1-800-827-1000</a> and choose "Option 7." Tell the operator you need to be enrolled in DEERS and ask for an email confirming when enrollment is complete.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>2. Then, register for your basic DS Logon account online.</strong></p>
                        <p>Go to the DS Logon self-service site and click on the button labeled "More DS Logon Options." From the choices that appear, select "Need a DS Logon?"</p>
                        <p><strong>You’ll be asked to choose how you want to register:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>If you have a Common Access Card (CAC) with accessible card reader,</strong> select this option. It’s the easiest way to get a DS Logon account and upgrade to a premium account right away.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you have a Defense Finance and Account Service (DFAS) myPay account,</strong> you can select this option. You’ll be able to upgrade to a premium account right away.</li>
                          <li><strong>If you don’t have a CAC or DFAS myPay account,</strong> select the "None of the above conditions apply" option.</li>
                        </ul>
                           <p>The registration tool will walk you through the sign-up process for your account and will prompt you to upgrade to a premium account through an online proofing process. Through this process, you’ll be asked a series of questions to prove you’re you—and not someone pretending to be you—to help protect the personal information you’ll have access to with a premium account.</p>
