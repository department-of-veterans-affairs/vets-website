                        <p>There are 2 levels of access for Vets.gov.</p>
                        <h4>Basic Access</h4>
                        <p>You can start by signing in with just your email address and a password that you've chosen. With this level of access, you can do things like save your online applications as you work on them and come back to finish filling them out later.</p>
                        <h4>Expanded access once you’ve verified your identity</h4>
                        <p>If you want to use more advanced Vets.gov tools to manage your benefits and services—like tracking your VA claims and appeals, downloading your full VA health record, or tracking how much of your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits you've used—you'll need to take extra steps to verify your identity. This means we’ll make sure you’re you (not someone pretending to be you) before we give you access to your personal information. </p>
                        <p>To get started, you’ll create an account through ID.me, our trusted technology partner in helping to keep your personal information safe.</p>
                        <p>Or, you can sign in with your <strong>My Health<em>e</em>Vet</strong> or <strong>DS Logon</strong> account (used to access eBenefits or milConnect)—and we'll connect your account to Vets.gov through ID.me. If you have a basic or advanced (non-premium) account, you’ll need to verify your identity through ID.me. We can also help you use ID.me to add an extra layer of security to your account (called 2-factor authentication).</p>

                        <p>When you sign in to Vets.gov, we'll protect your personal information by using the strongest identity verification system available to prevent fraud and identity theft. We’ll also give you the option to set up an extra layer of security (called 2-factor authentication) on your account. This helps to make sure that no one but you can access your account—even if they get your password.</p>
                        <p>
                          We’ve built Vets.gov to help you better access our agency’s vast digital system—so you can easily find, apply for, track, and use the benefits and services you’ve earned.

                        <p>If you’ve set up 2-factor authentication, ID.me will send a 6-digit verification code to your mobile or home phone. Enter this code where we ask you for it on the site to proceed with setting up your account on Vets.gov.</p>
                        <p>If you haven’t set up 2-factor authentication yet, you can do so any time from your Vets.gov profile page. Authentication gives you an extra layer of security by letting you into your account only after you’ve signed in with a password and a code sent directly to your mobile or home phone. This helps to make sure that no one but you can access your account—even if they get your password.</p>
