                      <p>To sign up for Vets.gov online, you only need an email address. Additional security is needed to use advanced features of the website (like refilling a VA prescription). To access those, you’ll need to take extra steps to verify your identity.</p>
                      <p>Even if you don't sign up with Vets.gov, you can still apply for the benefits you've earned.</p>

                      Why do I need to verify my identity for Vets.gov?

                    <div id="dbq2" class="usa-accordion-content">
                      <p>You need to verify your identity in order to protect your personal and health-related information.</p>
                      <p>With your verified ID.me account you can use Vets.gov on your mobile phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop to:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Use health tools, including refilling your VA prescription, sending messages to your healthcare team, and accessing your VA health record</li>
                        <li>Check the status of your claims and appeals</li>
                        <li>View Post-9/11 Bill enrollment information</li>
                        <li>Download VA letters related to your benefits and Veterans status</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        Because this type of information is personal and private, we work with our partners at ID.me to ensure Veterans are able to achieve the highest level of security that meets current industry standards for protecting data. This keeps your private information private by confirming that you are you — and not someone pretending to be you.

                      <p>Vets.gov confirms your identity using ID.me, which is a third-party Veteran-owned business that has partnered with VA to provide the strongest possible identity verification system to prevent fraud and identity theft. At this time, no government solution can provide this level of security, so a third-party product is required.</p>
                      <p>To go through the ID.me identity proofing process, you’ll need a smartphone and a driver’s license or passport. <a href="https://support.id.me/hc/en-us/articles/229334788-How-do-I-complete-the-LOA3-identity-proofing-process-">Follow these step-by-step instructions.</a></p>
                      <p>
                        If you don’t have a smartphone, you can still confirm your identity using ID.me. To do so, you’ll need access to a computer with an internet connection and a landline or mobile phone. <a href="https://support.id.me/hc/en-us/articles/229334788-How-do-I-complete-the-LOA3-identity-proofing-process-">Use these step-by-step instructions to verify your identity without a smartphone.</a>
