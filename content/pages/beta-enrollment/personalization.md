# Try Our New Beta Tools

<div itemprop="description"  class="va-introtext">
  
We invite you to try out our new beta tools—designed to make it easier for you to see important updates and manage your benefits and information on Vets.gov.

</div>

### What are beta tools?

These are new tools we're testing out to make sure they're working the way they should before we make them available to all Vets.gov users. We'll preview these tools together, and your feedback will help us make them better for others in the Veteran community.

### What will happen when I try out the beta tools?

You'll still have access to all the tools and information you've always had on Vets.gov. Plus, you'll gain temporary access to 3 new pages when you sign in:

- **A personalized homepage** where you'll see all your latest updates in one place—like the status of your prescription refills and disability claims and new secure messages from your health care team
- **A redesigned profile page** where you can review your personal and contact information—and find out how to update it as needed
- **A new account page** where you can review your settings for signing in to Vets.gov—and add extra security to your account if you want to
