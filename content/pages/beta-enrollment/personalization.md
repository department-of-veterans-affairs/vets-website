# Try Our New Beta Tools

<div itemprop="description"  class="va-introtext">
  
Based on feedback from Veterans like you, we're working to make Vets.gov even easier to use. We invite you to try out our new online tools that we hope will make it easier for you to see important updates and manage your benefits and information.

</div>

### What are beta tools, and why would I want to try them?

These are tools that we're testing out to make sure they're working the way they should before we make them available to all Vets.gov users. When you try out these tools, you'll get to use them right away.

### What will I get when I try out the beta tools?

You'll gain access to 3 new pages when you sign in to Vets.gov:

- **A personalized homepage** where you'll get quick access to your benefits and account information as well as important updates from the VA services you useâ€”like the latest status of your prescription refills or disability claims and any unread secure messages from your health care team
- **A redesigned profile page** where you can review and find out how to update your personal and contact information as needed
- **A new account page** where you can review your settings for signing in to Vets.gov and add extra security to your account, if needed

### Can I turn the beta tools off if I don't want to use them anymore?

Yes. You can opt out of the beta tools at any time. Just look for the opt-in information at the bottom of the account page.
