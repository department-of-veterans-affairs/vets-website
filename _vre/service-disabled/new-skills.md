If service-connected disabilities make it difficult for you to succeed in your career path, you may qualify for training through Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) that will help you pursue employment in a different field that suits your abilities. You may be eligible for this even if you also qualify for [GI Bill benefits](Link to education section).  However, you must decide which benefit you want to use.
