If service-connected disabilities make it difficult for you to succeed in your career path, you may qualify for training through Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) that will help you pursue employment in a different field that suits your abilities. You may be eligible for this even if you also qualify for [GI Bill benefits](/education/gi-bill/).  However, you must decide which benefit you want to use. 

### Are you eligible for VR&amp;E assistance?

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">
Yes, if:

- You are a Veteran or Servicemember with a service-connected disability and an employment barrier/handicap [enrolled in VR&amp;E](/vre/apply-vre/).
- Your service-connected disabilities impair your ability to prepare for, obtain and maintain suitable employment 
</div>


<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Who is eligible to apply?
You and your family
</div>

<div markdown="1">
### Benefits
- Comprehensive skills assessment
- Career counselor
- Education or training for a suitable vocational field, possibly including volunteer positions and OJT assistance.

### How it works
[Apply for VR&amp;E](/vre/apply-vre/) to find a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor who can assist you.

VR&amp;E is an employment program different from the GI Bill that may be used to pay for education you require to train for suitable employment.
