Veterans with service-connected disabilities have the opportunity to return to work with a former employer because of the [Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA)](http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/userra/). Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) can assist in this process by helping your employer accommodate your needs. Your VR&E counselor can provide a full range of rehabilitation services,  and can refer you directly to the Department of Labor to begin the process.
