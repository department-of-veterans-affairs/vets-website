VA may provide independent living services if your service-connected disability impairs your ability to work, and you need these services to live more independently. You may also receive independent-living services as you work to gain employment, if that’s a goal you and your counselor have created. In both cases, your counselor can help you restore your daily-living activities.

### Are you eligible for independent-living services?

<div markdown="1">
Yes, if:
-You are eligible for VR&E benefits.
- You have a service-connected disability rating of 20% or higher. 
- Your injuries prevent you from immediately seeking or returning to employment.

### How it works
A Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) will work with you to determine if you are not ready for employment because of the severity of your service-connected disabilities. The counselor will also determine if you will benefit from independent-living services.

Then, a counselor appointed through [Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment](/vre/service-disabled/apply-vre) will help you personalize an independent-living plan for your needs. The services generally last up to 24 months, but in some situations they may be extended beyond this time frame. 

Independent-living services may include evaluation and counseling to identify your needs and goals; home consultations with specialists; referral to support resources; and guidance in understanding your eligibility for VA home-modification programs.
