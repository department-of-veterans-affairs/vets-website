Veterans with service-connected disabilities have the opportunity to return to work with a former employer because of the [Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA)](http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/userra/). Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) can assist in this process by helping your employer accommodate your needs. 

Your VR&amp;E counselor can provide a full range of rehabilitation services, and can refer you directly to the Department of Labor to begin the process.
