          <h3> </h3>
          <p>If you have a service-connected disability that limits your ability to work or prevents you from working, VA’s Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) program can help you and, in some cases, your family members, explore career options and receive additional training. </p>

          <p>VA can help you find Veterans to hire and support them in your workplace.</p>
