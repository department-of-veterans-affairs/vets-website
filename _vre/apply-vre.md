Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) provides special career assistance to Veterans and Servicemembers who are overcoming challenges associated with service-connected disabilities. For Veterans and Servicemembers with service-connected disabilities so severe that they cannot immediately consider work, VR&amp;E offers services to improve their ability to live as independently as possible. Services may also be available to eligible family members.

### Are you eligible to apply for VR&amp;E?

</div>


<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

Yes, if:

- You are a Servicemember with a 20% or higher predischarge disability rating (memorandum rating) who will soon leave the military, or
- You are participating in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) process or awaiting discharge due to a medical condition resulting from a serious injury or illness that occurred in the line of duty, or
- You are a Veteran who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable and have a 10% or higher disability rating, and
- You separated from the military or received a service-connected disability rating from VA within the past 12 years.

**Note:** Veterans may be eligible for VR&amp;E after 12 years if VA determines their employment handicap warrants an extension.

</li>

<li class="step four wow fadeIn animated" markdown="1">

</li>

<li class="step five wow fadeIn animated" markdown="1">
If you are eligible, VA will invite you to an orientation session at the nearest VA Regional Office.
</li>

<li class="step six wow fadeIn animated" markdown="1">
If you are a Servicemember who has not yet received a service-connected disability rating, you do not need to wait for a rating. Instead, please fill out [VA Form 28-0588](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-28-0588-ARE.pdf).

**Note:** Servicemembers going through the Physical Evaluation Board process, as well as Servicemembers who expect an other-than-dishonorable discharge and who have a VA memorandum rating of 20% or more, or are in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES), may be eligible for VR&amp;E services.
</li>

<li class="step last seven wow fadeIn animated animated" markdown="0">

After you apply, you will be scheduled to meet with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) to determine if you have an employment handicap and if you are eligible for VR&amp;E benefits and services. You have an employment handicap if your service-connected disability impairs your ability to prepare for, find, and maintain suitable employment. After VA makes an entitlement decision, you and your counselor will work together to develop a rehabilitation plan. This plan outlines the rehabilitation and other services that VR&amp;E will provide.
