VetSuccess on Campus supports Veterans, Servicemembers and some eligible dependents in their transition from military to college life. [VA counselors at 94 college campuses](http://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/vsoc.asp) can help you with your Veterans’ benefits, health services and education benefits.
VetSuccess on Campus counselors can show you how to get referrals for health services and disability accommodations in the classroom. 

This program is also available to dependents of Veterans eligible for the [Fry Scholarship](/education/gi-bill/survivors-dependent-assistance/fry-scholarship/) or the [Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program](/education/gi-bill/survivors-dependent-assistance/dependents-education), or those who have had GI Bill benefits transferred to them from a spouse or parent.
