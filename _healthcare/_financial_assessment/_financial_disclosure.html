      Disclosure allows VA to accurately determine whether certain Veterans
      will be charged copays for care and medications, their eligibility for
      other services and enrollment. Veterans are not required to disclose
      their financial information; however, VA is not currently enrolling new
      applicants who decline to provide their financial information unless they
      have other qualifying eligibility factors (i.e., a former Prisoner of
      War, in <b>receipt of a Purple Heart, discharged for a disability incurred or
        aggravated in the line of duty, receiving VA service-connected disability
        compensation, receiving VA pension, in receipt of Medicaid benefits, or a
        recently discharged Combat Veteran (e.g., OEF/OIF/OND), who was
        discharged within the past 5 years are eligible for enrollment without
        disclosing their financial information)</b> but like other Veterans may
      provide their financial information to establish their eligibility for
      travel assistance, cost-free medications and/or medical care for services
      unrelated to military experience.
