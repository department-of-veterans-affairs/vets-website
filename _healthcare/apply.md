### How long will it take to process your application?

Less than one week. If more than a week has passed since you submitted your application and you have not heard back, do not apply again. Call **1-877-222-VETS**.

**Note:** When you apply online you will receive a confirmation number. Keep that number for your records.

### Are you eligible for VA health care?

If you served on active duty, and separated under conditions other than dishonorable, you may qualify for VA health care.

#### If at least one of the following applies to you, you probably qualify for VA health care:

- You receive financial compensation (pay) from the VA for a service-connected disability.
- You were discharged for a disability that happened or was made worse in the line of duty.
- You are a recently discharged Combat Veteran.
- You receive a VA pension.
- You are a former Prisoner of War.
- You have received a Purple Heart.
- You receive (or are eligible for) Medicaid benefits.
- You served in Vietnam between January 9, 1962 and May 7, 1975.
- You served in SW Asia during the Gulf War between August 2, 1990 and November 11, 1998.
- You served at least 30 days at Camp Lejeune between August 1, 1953 and December 31, 1987.

If none of the above apply to you, you may still qualify for care based on your income. Learn more about how the amount of money your family makes ([income threshold](http://nationalincomelimits.vaftl.us/)) can affect your eligibility for VA benefits.

**Notes:**

- If you separated under a dishonorable discharge to see if you qualify for health insurance, visit [healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/).

- Your most recent tax return will have most of information you need to qualify based on your income.
