# How Are URLs Created?

Understanding how content URLs are generated by Metalsmith helps prevent build errors. Here's how it works.

- Document paths are based on the Markdown file paths. 
- Each Markdown file generates a corresponding directory and `index.html` file. For example: 
  - `_education/tools-programs.md` &rarr; `/education/tools-programs/index.html`
  - `_education/tools-programs.md` &rarr; `/education/tools-programs/index.html`
  - `_education/work-learn/non-traditional.md` &rarr; `_education/work-learn/non-traditional/index.html`

_**Make sure that every collection sub-directory also has a Markdown file that shares its name.**_ Take the the `_employment/job-seekers/` directory as an example. It also has an `_employment/job-seekers.md` file. Each Markdown file in `_employment/job-seekers/` compiles to  `employment/jobs-seekers/name_of_markdown_file/index.html`, while `_employment/job-seekers.md` itself compiles to `employment/job-seekers/index.html`.

Failing to take the above step means that you could generate breadcrumbs to pages that do not exist. This can [cause your tests to fail](docs/WhyIsMyBuildBreaking.md).
