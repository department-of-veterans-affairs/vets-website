# Disability Benefits

### Exposure

- **Agent Orange**
  - Main page width is larger than other content pages (possibly because of exposure location cards at the bottom of the page?)

  - **Exposure Locations**
    - Duplicate page heading

- Inconsistent use of horizontal rules on informational pages above "How it Works" section

### Claim Types

- **Claim Types page - list navigation of each claim type** 
  - There is a lot of user interaction cost to navigate to these separate pages one at a time, considering most of them are short on content
  - Consider putting all of these onto one page with an anchor link index at the top like an FAQ page

### BVA Appeals

- The text in this page's callout box doesn't seem appropriate for the callout format

### Apply

- "Who should read this" should be in a callout box (the same content is in a callout on the Education Apply page)
- Content width of the top section is too wide
