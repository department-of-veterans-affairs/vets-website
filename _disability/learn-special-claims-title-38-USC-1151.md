If you were injured or have an injury that was aggravated while receiving VA-sponsored medical treatment, pursuing a course of vocational rehabilitation (under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31), or participating in compensated work therapy (under 38 U.S.C. 1718), you may be eligible for compensation.

Title 38 U.S.C. Section 1151 allows VA to pay compensation for death or disability "as if service-connected." The disability is not considered service connected. If eligibility is established under Section 1151, the disability is considered service connected for payment purposes ONLY.

### Eligibility Requirements

You must have a disabling condition that is the result of or has been aggravated due to VA-sponsored medical treatment or training.

#### Example

While engaged in on-the-job training as a car mechanic under VA's Chapter 31 Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment program, a Veteran was injured when a jack slipped from under a car and crushed his left foot. Disability compensation may be paid for his foot injury because the injury occurred while the Veteran was pursuing training under a VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment program.
