If you have one or more service connected disabilities that prevent you from maintaining gainful employment then you may qualify for a rating under the umbrella of Individual Unemployability. If designated individually unemployable, you will be compensated at the 100% rate - even if your actual service-connected disability rating is less than 100%.   

### Example 1

A Veteran has a service-connected heart condition evaluated as 60% disabling. She has been able to work without difficulty until last year, when she began to experience chest pain with any exertion. Her physician recommended that she retire as soon as possible. She subsequently filed a claim for increased disability compensation. Evidence regarding the Veteran's work history and education were reviewed and she was designated individually unemployable due to her service-connected disability and entitled to compensation at the same rate as a 100% disabled Veteran.

### Example 2

A Veteran served as a medic in Vietnam and stepped on a land mine, severing his right leg below the knee. He wears a prosthesis that allows him good mobility. He had a great deal of difficulty readjusting to civilian life and was recently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Service connection was established for both disabilities. The ratings for these disabilities are 40% and 50%, respectively. The combined disability rating is 70%.
He applied for individual unemployability because he has not been able to maintain gainful employment for many years. His only income during the last two years has come from a neighbor who pays him to watch his dogs while he's out of town. The evidence established that his service-connected disabilities rendered him unemployable and entitled to compensation at the same rate as a 100% disabled Veteran.
