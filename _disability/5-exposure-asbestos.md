Additionally, some service occupations, tasks, and workplaces may have exposed you to asbestos, including shipyards, construction, and vehicle repair.

#### How it works

Several military occupational specialties have a risk of exposure to asbestos, including mining, milling, shipyard work, insulation work, demolition of old buildings, carpentry, and construction. VA also recognizes a risk of exposure in the manufacturing and installation of flooring, roofing, cement sheet, and pipe products, and the servicing of friction products such as clutch facings and brake linings. If you served in one of these specialties, you should be tested for related health risks. You must have been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.
