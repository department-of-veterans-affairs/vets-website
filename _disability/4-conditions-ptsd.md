### Are you in crisis? You have options.

- Call 911
- Go to the nearest emergency room

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Basics

If you have symptoms of PTSD and were exposed to serious trauma or a life-threatening event during your military service, you may be eligible for benefits, including compensation and health care. 

### Are you eligible for compensation?

Yes, if: 
-	You have a PTSD diagnosis
-	You have symptoms related to a traumatic event (the "stressor")
-	You have seen a VA psychiatrist or psychologist who has confirmed that the triggering stressor was enough to cause PTSD
-	The stressor is related either to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity or to [military sexual trauma](http://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/factsheets/serviceconnected/MST.pdf)
-	The stressor is one that is likely to have happened in the locations and circumstances of your service

### Who is covered
You

### Available benefits
-	Compensation 
-	Health care 

### How it works
PTSD is a complex and serious disorder. New regulations passed in 2010 make it easier for Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder to qualify for VA disability benefits. Combat service is not necessarily a requirement. 

You may have PTSD if you experience the following symptoms:
-	You have nightmares or persistent memories of the event, or you relive the event over and over.
-	You do not talk to anyone about the event, avoiding any situation that may trigger bad memories related to it.
-	You feel numb and detached, depressed, and disinterested in normal life activities.
-	You feel on high alert all the time, always watching for danger.

If you have any of these [symptoms](http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/pages/symptoms_of_ptsd.asp), make an appointment with a mental health professional. They can give you help and determine if you are suffering from PTSD.

Note: VA is committed to providing the best care and resources for our Veterans diagnosed with PTSD. We have made significant progress in PTSD treatments and are expanding access by increasing the number of mental health providers at VA medical centers.
