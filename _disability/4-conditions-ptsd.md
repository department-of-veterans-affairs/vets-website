If you display symptoms of PTSD and were exposed to serious trauma or a life-threatening event during your military service, you may be eligible for benefits, including compensation and health care.  

### PTSD Basics

PTSD is a complex and serious disorder. VA is committed to providing the best care and resources for our Veterans diagnosed with PTSD. We have made historic progress in PTSD treatments and are expanding access by increasing the number of mental health providers at VA medical centers. Learn more about VA's programs, support groups, and research efforts focused on helping those with PTSD.

#### Common symptoms of PTSD include:

- Persistent memories of the event, nightmares, reliving the event over and over
- Not talking to anyone about the event, avoiding any situation that may trigger bad memories related to the event
- Feeling numb and detached, depressed, and disinterested in normal life activities
- Feeling on high alert all the time, always watching for danger

#### Eligibility Requirements

New regulations passed in 2010 make it easier for Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder to qualify for VA disability benefits. Combat service is not necessarily a requirement. The following requirements must be met:

- You must have a PTSD diagnosis.
- Your symptoms must be related to a traumatic event (the "stressor").
- A VA psychiatrist or psychologist must confirm that the triggering stressor was enough to cause PTSD.
- The stressor is related either to [fear of hostile military or terrorist activity or to military sexual trauma](http://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/factsheets/serviceconnected/MST.pdf).
- The stressor is one that is likely to have happened in the locations and circumstances of your service.

If you have any of these symptoms, make an appointment with a mental health professional to determine if you are suffering from PTSD. In addition to applying for disability benefits, you can also apply for VA health care benefits.
