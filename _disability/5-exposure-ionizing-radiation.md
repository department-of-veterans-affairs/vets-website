### Exposure to Ionizing Radiation

If you have certain diseases, including some cancers, and you were exposed to ionizing radiation during service, VA may consider those diseases to be service related. [See a complete list of these diseases in 38 CFR 3.311(b)(2)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=39c7e367a71c8efc570650851b266303&rgn=div5&view=text&node=38:1.0.1.1.4&idno=38#38:1.0.1.1.4.1.66.119)

### Are you eligible for compensation?

Yes, if:

-	You were exposed to ionizing radiation during military service in one of the following ways:
-	As a participant in atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, or
-	As a participant in the postwar occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, or
-	As a prisoner of war in Japan, or
-	While performing other radiation-risk activities, such as working as an x-ray technician or performing work in a reactor plant, in nuclear medicine, or in radiography (Your exposure to ionizing radiation must have occurred while serving on active duty or as a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces during a period of active duty for training or inactive duty for training), or
- 	While performing tasks similar to those performed by a Department of Energy (DOE) employee that qualifies the DOE employee as a member of the Special Exposure Cohort. (See 42 U.S.C. 7384L(14))[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7384l]
-	You have one of the recognized radiogenic diseases or an unlisted disease for which a medical opinion shows a relationship between the disease and exposure to radiation
-	The radiogenic disease has manifested within a certain period of time  
-	You were discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.

### How it works

The evidence must show the existence of a radiogenic disease listed in 38 CFR 3.311(a) or an unlisted disease for which a medical opinion has been submitted showing a relationship between the disease and exposure to radiation, and service records must show exposure to ionizing radiation. VA requests from the appropriate military service or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency an estimate of your level or range of radiation exposure. The military service or agency reports to VA the range within which a Veteran may have been exposed, and VA accepts the highest level of the dose range. See 38 CFR 3.311(b)(5) for more information.
