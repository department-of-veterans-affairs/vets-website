The U.S. military sprayed millions of gallons of Agent Orange and other herbicides on trees and vegetation during the Vietnam War. Several decades later, concerns about the health effects from these chemicals continue.

If you were exposed to Agent Orange or other herbicides during military service, you may be eligible for a variety of VA benefits, including disability compensation for diseases associated with exposure. Your dependents and survivors also may be eligible for benefits.

Agent Orange refers to a blend of tactical herbicides the U.S. military sprayed in the jungles of Vietnam and around the Korean demilitarized zone to remove the trees and dense tropical foliage that provided enemy cover. Herbicides were also used by the U.S. military to defoliate military facilities in the U.S. and in other countries as far back as the 1950s.

In addition, VA has determined that there is evidence of exposure to Agent Orange for Air Force and Air Force Reserve members who served from 1969 through 1986 and who regularly and repeatedly operated, maintained, or served onboard C-123 aircraft, which was used to spray the herbicide during the Vietnam War era. Read more about service qualifications and other eligibility criteria related to exposure to Agent Orange through duty on contaminated C-123 aircraftAgent Orange C-123 web page.

VA and federal law presumes that certain diseases are a result of exposure to these herbicides. This presumptive policy simplifies the process for receiving compensation for these diseases since VA foregoes the normal requirement that you prove that an illness began during or was worsened by your military service.

If you believe you have a disease caused by Agent Orange exposure that is not one of the associated conditions [LINK], you must show a connection between the disease and herbicide exposure during military service.

VA offers eligible Veterans a free Agent Orange Registry health exam for possible long-term health problems related to exposure.

#### Blue Water Veterans and Agent Orange Exposure

If you served on a Navy ship off the coast of Vietnam and at any time came ashore or served on the inland waterways anytime between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, VA presumes that you were exposed to Agent Orange or other herbicides. If this is the case, you may claim a service-connection for diseases related to Agent Orange exposure, and you may be eligible for an Agent Orange Registry health exam. In addition, you and your dependents and survivors may be eligible for health care and disability compensation.

To service-connect your disability under this situation, your military record must show that you were aboard one of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships that operated in Vietnam.  

If you did not go ashore in Vietnam or serve aboard ships that operated on the inland waterways of Vietnam anytime between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, you must show that you were exposed to herbicides during military service in order to receive disability compensation for diseases related to Agent Orange exposure. These claims are decided on a case-by-case basis.

Exception: If you are a Blue Water Veteran with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, you may be granted service-connection without showing inland waterway service or that you went ashore in Vietnam. This is because VA also recognizes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as related to service in Vietnam or the offshore waters of Vietnam during the Vietnam Era.

##### Need help determining exposure?

VA can help you determine Agent Orange exposure or qualifying service in Vietnam after you file a claim for compensation benefits.

#### Veterans Exposed to Agent Orange through Duty on Contaminated C-123 Aircraft

In response to the Institute of Medicine’s report on Post-Vietnam Dioxin Exposure in Agent Orange-Contaminated C-123 Aircraft from the National Academy of Sciences, we have determined there is evidence of exposure to Agent Orange for Airmen who worked on C-123s that were used in Vietnam as part of Operation Ranch Hand. Specifically, we have determined there is sufficient evidence that Air Force and Air Force Reserve members who served during the period 1969 through 1986 and regularly and repeatedly operated, maintained, or served onboard C-123 aircraft (known to have been used to spray an herbicide agent during the Vietnam era) were exposed to Agent Orange.

We encourage eligible Air Force and/or Air Force Reserve personnel who meet certain service qualifications, and have any of the medical conditions determined by VA to be related to exposure to Agent Orange, to apply for benefits.

##### Active Duty Qualifications

If you meet all of the following criteria, you should apply for benefits.

- You served in a regular Air Force unit location where a contaminated C-123 was assigned.
- You had regular and repeated contact with C-123 aircraft through flight, ground, or medical duties.
- You have an Agent Orange-related disability.

See the list of affected military units, Air Force specialty codes, and dates of service for Air Force Veterans who may have been exposed to Agent Orange.

##### Reservists Qualifications

If you have an Agent Orange related disability and you were assigned to flight, ground, or medical crew duties at any of the following locations, you should apply for benefits.

- Lockbourne/Rickenbacker Air Force Base in Ohio (906th and 907th Tactical Air Groups or 355th and 356th Tactical Airlift Squadron).
- Westover Air Force Base in Massachusetts (731st Tactical Air Squadron and 74th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron) or Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
- International Airport (758th Airlift Squadron).

We will presume that your Agent Orange condition had its onset during your Reserve training.
