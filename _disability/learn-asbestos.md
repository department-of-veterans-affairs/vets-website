### Asbestos Exposure

If you were exposed to asbestos while serving and have developed a disease related to asbestos exposure, you may be eligible for disability benefits. Some service occupations, tasks, and workplaces make exposure to asbestos more likely. These include mining, milling, shipyards, insulation work, building demolition, carpentry, and construction. In addition, the manufacturing and installation of products such as flooring, roofing, cement sheet, and pipe products, and the servicing of friction products such as clutch facings and brake linings, make exposure to asbestos more likely.

If you served in Iraq or other countries in that region, you could have been exposed to asbestos when older buildings were damaged, releasing the contaminant into the air.

#### Eligibility Requirements

- You must have been exposed to asbestos while in military service
- You must have a disease or disability related to the asbestos exposure that occurred in military service
- You must be a Veteran who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable
