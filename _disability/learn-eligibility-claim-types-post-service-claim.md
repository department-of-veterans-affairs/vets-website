### Claims Based on Post-Service - Diseases After Service

If you have a service-related disability that presents itself after you have separated, you may eligible for disability compensation. An overview of these types of disability compensation claims is below.

#### Agent Orange

VA presumes that if you served in Vietnam or in or near the Korean demilitarized zones, during certain time periods, you were exposed to Agent Orange. If your service falls within these parameters and you have a disease related to Agent Orange exposure, you may be eligible for disability compensation. If you have a disease associated with Agent Orange but do not meet the service requirements for VA to "presume" they were exposed to Agent Orange, you must show a connection between the disease and herbicide exposure during military service.


#### Disabilities That Appear Within One Year After Discharge

Veterans with certain diseases that presented themselves after discharge from military service may be eligible for disability compensation. This includes certain diseases that were not incurred in or aggravated by military service, but which VA presumes are related to military service if shown to exist within a certain time period after service. Examples include hypertension, arthritis, diabetes mellitus, and peptic ulcers.


#### Exposures to Hazardous Materials

You may have been exposed to chemical, physical, and environmental hazards during military service.  If exposure to these hazards resulted in a disease or injury you may be entitled to disability compensation. Examples include exposure to radiation, mustard gas, and asbestos.


#### Gulf War Illnesses

Gulf War Veterans suffering from what is commonly referred to as "Gulf War Syndrome," which is a cluster of medically unexplained chronic symptoms that can include fatigue, headaches, joint pain, indigestion, insomnia, dizziness, respiratory disorders, and memory problems may be eligible for disability compensation. In addition, Gulf War Veterans who served in Southwest Asia and have a disability resulting from certain infectious diseases may be eligible for disability compensation.

#### Prisoners of War (POWs)

VA presumes that certain medical conditions are associated with a Former POW's captivity. If you are a former POW and have been diagnosed with one or more of these conditions, VA presumes that it is associated with the POW experience and you are entitled to disability compensation.
