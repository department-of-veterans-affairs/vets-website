### Convalescence—Temporary Rating Due to Surgery or Immobilization

If you have undergone surgery or immobilization of a joint by a cast for a service-connected disability, you may be eligible for a temporary 100% disability rating. This temporary rating may continue for one to three months (and up to six months in extreme cases) depending on individual circumstances.

#### Example
A Veteran has a left knee condition that resulted in a 30% disability rating. Due to further deterioration of the knee, the VA physician recommended surgery to arrest the problem. Since the success of the surgery won't be known for three months following the one week of hospitalization, VA granted the Veteran a temporary 100% disability rating for three months.

#### Eligibility Requirements

- You must have had a surgery or other treatment performed by a VA hospital or an approved hospital or outpatient facility for a service-connected disability
- The evidence must show that the surgery or treatment was for a service-connected disability and
- The surgery required convalescence of at least one month or
- The surgery resulted in severe postoperative residuals, such as incompletely healed surgical wounds, stumps of recent amputations, therapeutic immobilizations, house confinement, or required use of a wheelchair or crutches or
- One major joint or more was immobilized by a cast without surgery
