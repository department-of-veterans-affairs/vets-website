After you have [filed a substantive appeal](http://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA9.pdf) to [your regional office](http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/offices.asp) and have received a final decision from the Board of Veterans’ Appeals, if you want to pursue further action, you may then appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.  

The Court is composed of seven permanent, active judges and two additional judges as part of a temporary expansion provision. The Court has exclusive jurisdiction over decisions of the Board of Veterans’ Appeals (“the Board” or BVA). The Court reviews Board decisions appealed by claimants who believe the Board erred in its decision. The Court’s review of Board decisions is based on the record before the agency and arguments of the parties, which are presented in a written brief, with oral argument generally held only in cases presenting new legal issues.

The Court’s principal office is in Washington, D.C., but the Court is authorized to sit anywhere in the United States and does so a limited number of times each year.

You must have a final decision from the Board of Veterans’ Appeals, not the regional office, before you can appeal to this Court.
