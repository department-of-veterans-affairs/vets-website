### Blue Water Veterans and Agent Orange Exposure

If you served on a Navy ship off the coast of Vietnam and at any time came ashore or served on the inland waterways anytime between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, VA presumes that you were exposed to Agent Orange or other herbicides. If this is the case, you may claim a service-connection for [diseases related to Agent Orange exposure](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/conditions/index.asp), and you may be eligible for an [Agent Orange Registry health exam](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/benefits/registry-exam.asp). In addition, you and your dependents and survivors may be eligible for health care and disability compensation.

To service-connect your disability under this situation, your military record must show that you were aboard one of the [U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships that operated in Vietnam](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/shiplist/index.asp).

If you did not go ashore in Vietnam or serve aboard ships that operated on the inland waterways of Vietnam anytime between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, you must show that you were exposed to herbicides during military service in order to receive disability compensation for diseases related to Agent Orange exposure. These claims are decided on a case-by-case basis.

**Exception:** If you are a Blue Water Veteran with [non-Hodgkin's lymphoma](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/conditions/nonhodgkinslymphoma.asp), you may be granted service-connection without showing inland waterway service or that you went ashore in Vietnam. This is because VA also recognizes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as related to service in Vietnam or the offshore waters of Vietnam during the Vietnam Era.

**Need help determining exposure?**

VA can help you determine Agent Orange exposure or qualifying service in Vietnam after you [file a claim for compensation benefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage).
