### What is disability compensation?

#### Disability compensation is a tax-free monetary benefit paid to a Veteran by the US Government.
A disability can result from a disease or injury sustained, or aggravated, while a Veteran was on active duty or even if the injury appeared after the Veteran's period of active duty service. Disability compensation is generally linked to the loss of work directly, or indirectly, by that disability.

There are different types of disability claims and there are different ways to process a claim.
