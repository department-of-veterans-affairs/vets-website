If you were hospitalized for more than 21 continuous days for a service-connected disability, you may be eligible to receive a 100% disability rating for the period of hospitalization. To qualify for this provision you must have been hospitalized at a VA or VA-approved facility for a service-connected disability.  

### Example

A Veteran with a 40% service-connected disability rating for diabetes mellitus was hospitalized at a VA facility after lapsing into a diabetic coma. He required over 25 days of hospitalization due to the coma and associated infections. Upon adjudication of his claim, his rating was temporarily raised to 100% for the period of his hospitalization. After this period, his disability rating reverted to 40%.

### Eligibility Requirements:

You must have been hospitalized for more than 21 days in a Department of Veterans Affairs or an approved hospital for a service-connected disability, or you must have been under hospital observation at Department of Veterans Affairs expense for a service-connected disability for a period in excess of 21 days.
