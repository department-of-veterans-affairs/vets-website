If you are a former POW with disabilities related to your captivity, you may be eligible for compensation. VA has identified several conditions presumed to be related to the deprivations, traumas, and cold injuries sustained by POWs. If you are a former POW and have been diagnosed as at least 10% disabled by one or more of the conditions listed below, VA presumes that the condition is associated with the POW experience:

- Osteoporosis (on or after October 10, 2008, if the POW has PTSD)
- Neuropsychiatric condition, including psychosis, dysthymic disorder (depressive neurosis), and any of the anxiety states (e.g., PTSD)
- Cold injury
- Traumatic arthritis
- Stroke
- Heart disease

The following additional conditions are presumed to be service connected for former POWs who were captive for 30 days or more:

- Osteoporosis (on or after September 28, 2009)
- Nutritional deficiencies, including avitaminosis, beriberi, malnutrition, and pellagra
- Helminthiasis
- Peripheral neuropathy
- Digestive disorders, including peptic ulcer disease, chronic dysentery, irritable bowel syndrome, and cirrhosis of the liver
