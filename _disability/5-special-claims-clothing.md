### Available benefits

- A one-time or yearly allowance for reimbursement

### How it works

To receive annual payment, you must establish eligibility by August 1 of the year for which you claim payment. View the current [rate table](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/special_Benefit_Allowances_2012.asp) to determine the benefit amount. Additional clothing allowances may be provided if more than one prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, or skin medication, is used and/or it affects more than one type of clothing garment.

Submit VA Form 10-8678, Application for Annual Clothing Allowance, to the prosthetic representative at your local VA medical center. You can use the facility locator to locate your nearest VA health care facility. For more information, call VA toll free at 1-800-827-1000. VA collects applications throughout the year and holds them until the August 1 closing date.
