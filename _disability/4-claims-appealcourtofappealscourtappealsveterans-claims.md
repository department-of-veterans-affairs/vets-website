If you are not satisfied with the results of a claim for Veterans benefits, you can file a [substantive appeal](http://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA9.pdf) to your [regional office](http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/offices.asp).

Your appeal will be reviewed by the Board of Veterans’ Appeals (also known as BVA or the “Board”), which is composed of attorneys experienced in:
- Veterans’ law
- Reviewing benefit claims

Typically, it takes approximately 80 weeks for an appeal to be reviewed and decided upon.
