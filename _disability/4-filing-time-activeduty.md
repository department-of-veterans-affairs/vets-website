The best time to start the process of filing a disability claim is while you are on active duty in pre-discharge status,. Processing times tend to be faster for claims submitted pre-separation than for those submitted after separation has occurred.

If you are in pre-discharge status, you may file a claim for disability compensation up to 180 days prior to separation or retirement from active duty or release from full-time Reserve or National Guard periods of duty.

If you are between 180 and 60 days from separation, you can begin the Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. From 59 days until separation, you can initiate the Quick Start program.

### Integrated Disability Evaluation System

The Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) Examination Templates page is used to determine a Service Member's fitness for duty. If you are found medically unfit for duty, the IDES proposes a VA disability rating before you leave the service.

### Overseas Intake Sites

If you are stationed within the Kaiserslautern Military Community (KMC), you can visit the Landstuhl Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) office and start the disability claim process while you are on active duty in a predischarge status. Walk-in hours are from Tuesday through Thursday 10:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 15:00 hours.

If you are stationed outside the KMC, you can participate in the BDD or Quick Start programs through the "Fly-in" claim process. The Fly-in claim process allows you to submit applications by fax or e-mail in advance of your in-person appointment. To participate in the Fly-in claim process:

- Contact the Landstuhl BDD office by phone, fax, or e-mail to request all necessary information and forms.  

- After you complete and return the application, a BDD officer will contact you by e-mail to schedule an examination at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center(LRMC) and to notify you about the information and evidence required to support the claim.

- You are responsible for contacting the clinics at LRMC to schedule necessary exams as directed, and for arranging your travel and gaining the approval of your command to make the trip.

- When you report for your examinations, you must bring a copy of your Service Treatment Records (STRs), which will be submitted to VA and not returned. BDD and Quick Start claims cannot be processed without the STRs.
