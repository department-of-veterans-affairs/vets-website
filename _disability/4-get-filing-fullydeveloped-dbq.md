### Fully Developed Claim

The Fully Developed Claims (FDC) program is an optional way for Veterans and survivors to get faster decisions by submitting all relevant records in their possession, and those records which are easily obtainable, such as private medical records, when they make their claim and certify that they have no further evidence to submit. VA can process these claims more quickly.

### Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs)

To speed up the processing of compensation and pension claims, you now have the option of completing an examination with your own healthcare provider instead of at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility.  

If you choose to go to your own healthcare provider, you will need to bring the appropriate Disability Benefits Questionnaires, or DBQs. These downloadable forms that are specific to your [condition](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_ListByDBQFormName.asp) or [symptom](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_ListBySymptom.asp) enable private healthcare providers to capture important information needed by VA to accurately evaluate and promptly decide on your claims for benefits.

Visit our [DBQ List by Form Name](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_ListByDBQFormName.asp) or [DBQ List by Symptom](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_ListBySymptom.asp) to access the 70 forms available. See detailed instructions:

-	[Veteran](http://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/dbq_veteraninstruct.asp)
-	[VSO](http://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/dbq_vsoinstruct.asp)
-	[Health Care Provider](http://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/dbq_providerinstruct.asp )

### Where can I get more information?

See our [DBQ Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_FAQS.asp) for more information. You can also call us at 1-800-827-1000 or [ask us a question online](https://iris.custhelp.com/app/ask/session/L3RpbWUvMTMyMzEwMDk5My9zaWQvM0htaElRS2s%3D).

DBQs help support VA's Fully Developed Claims (FDC) program. DBQs are valuable for claims processing because they provide medical information that is relevant to determining a disability rating. When submitted with a [Fully Developed Claim](http://benefits.va.gov/transformation/fastclaims/), DBQs ensure VA's rating specialists have precisely the information they need to start processing the claim.

If you’re an active-duty Servicemember, you can initiate a [predischarge claim](/disability-benefits/get/filing/active-duty/).
