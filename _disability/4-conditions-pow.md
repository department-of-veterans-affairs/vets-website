If you are a former POW with disabilities related to your service and captivity, you may be eligible for compensation. If, after your service, you are diagnosed as being at least 10% disabled by one or more of the conditions listed below, VA presumes it is because of your POW experience, no matter how long you were in captivity.
</div>

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Are you eligible for compensation?

Yes, if:

-	You have osteoporosis (if you filed your claim on or after October 10, 2008, #and you have a PTSD diagnosis)
-	You have a neuropsychiatric condition, including psychosis, dysthymic disorder (depressive neurosis), and any of the anxiety states (for example, PTSD)
-	You have a cold injury (Lasting effects of frostbite from detention in a cold climate.)
-	You have post-traumatic osteoarthritis
-	You have experienced a stroke
-	You have hypertensive vascular disease, including hypertensive heart disease

</div>

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### For former POWs who were captive for 30 days or more, the following additional conditions are presumed to be service connected:

-	Osteoporosis (for claims filed on or after September 28, 2009; no PTSD diagnosis is required.)
-	Any nutritional deficiencies, including avitaminosis, beriberi, malnutrition â€“ including optic atrophy connected to malnutrition -- and pellagra
-	Helminthiasis
-	Peripheral neuropathy (unless caused by infectious disease.)
-	Digestive disorders, including peptic ulcer disease, chronic dysentery, irritable bowel syndrome, and cirrhosis of the liver

#### Available benefits

-	Compensation benefits
-	Health care benefits

#### How it works

Certain conditions are presumed to be related to time spent in captivity. These presumptive disabilities are based on studies of the long-term effects of captivity, deprivation, trauma, and cold injury. If a former POW is diagnosed as having one or more of these conditions to a degree that is at least 10% disabling, VA presumes that it is associated with the POW experience.
