If you were exposed to contaminated drinking water while serving at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, between August 1953, and January 1988,  and have developed a disease considered to be related to this exposure, you may be eligible for disability benefits.   

### Eligibility Requirements

- You must have served at Camp Lejeune during the period of contamination (August 1953 through 1987)
- You must have a current disease and a medical opinion that states the disease is a result of exposure to the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune
- You must be a Veteran who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.

### Background

Between August 1953 and January 1988, two on-base water-supply systems at Marine Corps Base in Lejeune, North Carolina, were contaminated with the volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene (TCE), a metal degreaser, and perchloroethylene (PCE), a dry cleaning agent. Benzene, vinyl chloride, and other compounds were also found to be contaminating the water-supply systems.
