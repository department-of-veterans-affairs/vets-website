<li class="step two wow fadeIn animated" markdown="1">

##### Apply

You can submit your claim several ways.

- [Online](#)
- By Phone: 1-800-000-000
- By Mail: Attn: Claims Submission, 810 Vermont St., Washington, DC, 09201
- In Person

And there are two claim types.

The VA currently recommends submitting a Fully Developed Claim online. This process is usually the fastest way to get a decision on your application.

- [Fully Developed Claim (FDC)](#) (Recommended)
- [Standard Claim](#)
- [Apply Now for Disability Benefits](#)

</li>

<li class="step three va wow fadeIn animated" markdown="1">

##### VA Review

- A Veterans Service Representative at VA is assigned to review your claim.
- *The Veterans Service Representative may decide that more information is needed to make a decision.*

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

##### If The VA Needs More Information

- The Representative may contact you for more information and/or may work with you to schedule a medical examination for you at a VA facility or a cooperating health care provider facility.
- If you are scheduled for an exam this will be a special exam only to review your disability claim and not for a general check-up or for other health conditions that you may have at the time of the exam.
- The Veterans Service Representative may also reach out to other government agencies, such as the Department of Defense, to request more information.

The Veterans Service Representative who reviews your claim may go through more than one round of Reviewing and Clarifying the information that supports your claim. Every claim is different because every Veteran is different. Some claims may require no additional information to make a decision, and some claims may require multiple rounds to make a decision.

</div>

</li>


<li class="step last four wow fadeIn animated" markdown="1">

When the Veterans Service Representative reviewing your claim has assembled enough information *they will make a decision on your claim and send it to you by mail.*

###### Do I need anything while I'm waiting?

Unless VA writes to you and asks for additional information there is nothing you need to do. VA will send you a letter if further information is needed. This letter will outline the evidence needed to support your claim.
