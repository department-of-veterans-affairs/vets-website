##### VA Review

###### The amount of time it takes to process your claim depends on several factors:

- The type of claim you filed.
- How many injuries or disabilities you claimed and how complicated they are.
- How hard it is for VA to gather the evidence needed to decide your claim.

</div>


<div class="feature" markdown="1">

###### Here’s what happens once you’ve filed your claim:

1. VA receives your claim, and it is time and date stamped. **(Claim Received)**
2. A Veterans Service Representative (VSR) examines your claim. **(Under Review)**
3. If VA needs additional information (evidence), the VSR will ask you for it or obtain it separately. **(Gathering of Evidence)**
4. The VSR studies the evidence and makes a recommendation for a rating decision.
**(Review of Evidence)**
5. The VSR prepares a report recommending what your rating decision should be. **(Preparation for a Decision)**
6. A reviewing official examines the VSR report and makes a final rating determination.
**(Pending Decision Approval)**

</div>

<div markdown="1">

###### What if VA needs more information?

- VA may reach out on your behalf to other governmental agencies, such as the Department of Defense, to find records.
- If VA needs more medical information, they may ask you to provide it.  They may schedule an exam for you at either a VA facility or a civilian health care provider. (Please note: This isn’t a general medical exam. It’s to check out the injuries you listed on your benefits claim.)

###### Do I need to do anything while I’m waiting?

VA will send you a letter if they need more information. Unless VA writes and asks you for additional information, there is nothing else you need to do.

##### Decision

When the VA Veterans Service Representative reviewing your claim has studied all the information you submitted, as well as what VA may have gathered on your behalf, the VSR will make a decision and send it to you in a letter.

If you disagree with this decision, you may [file an appeal]({{ site.url }}/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/).
