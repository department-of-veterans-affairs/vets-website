It is possible for your service-connected disability to be cause or worsen a another disability.  If this is the case, you could file a Secondary Disability Claim to seek additional benefit. This second disability may not otherwise be considered service-connected.

### Example 1

A Veteran has a service-connected knee injury that causes him to walk with a limp. He subsequently develops arthritis in his hip. Although the arthritic condition was not incurred during or aggravated by service, service-connection may still be established if the arthritis is a result of his previously establish service-connected knee condition.

### Example 2

A Veteran was in the Army for twenty years. During her military service, she was diagnosed with hypertension. After her discharge, service-connection was established for hypertension. She was subsequently diagnosed with a heart condition. Service-connection for her heart condition may be established via a Secondary Claim.
