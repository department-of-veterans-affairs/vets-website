# Copilot Instructions
This is a monorepo for VA.gov, with shared code in `src/platform` and individual React applications under `src/applications`.

## General Instructions
- vets-website uses yarn, Javascript, React, RJSF, Redux, React router, platform/forms-system, platform/forms, and the va.gov design system.
- Uses Webpack for bundling application assets.
- Use prettier conventions with 2 spaces for indentation, single quotes, and trailing commas.
- When using React, prefer web components such as va-button, va-text-input, or VaButton, VaTextInput, instead of HTML elements.
- When using RJSF, prefer web component patterns from `platform/forms-system/src/js/web-component-patterns` for individual fields for both uiSchema and schema such as textUI and textSchema.
- For unit tests, use mocha, chai, sinon, and prefer RTL over Enzyme.
- For E2E tests, use Cypress.
- Prefer functional components and hooks for new components.
- Files should end with a newline.
- Use â€™ instead of ' for apostrophes in text content.
- Use `yarn lint:js:working:fix` to fix formatting issues.
- All code should conform to WCAG 2.2 AA and Section 508 accessibility guidelines.

## Development Commands
- Use `yarn install` to fetch dependencies (run when package.json changes)
- Use `yarn build` to build all applications
- Use `yarn build --entry=app1,app2` to build specific applications
- Use `yarn watch` to run the webpack dev server with hot reloading
- Use `yarn watch --env entry=app1,app2` to limit webpack builds to specific apps
- Use `yarn watch --env api=https://dev-api.va.gov` to use a remote API instead of local
- Use `nohup yarn watch --env entry=app-name > /dev/null 2>&1 &` to run the dev server port 3001 in background
- Application entry names are found in each app's `manifest.json` file under `entryName`
- For Codespaces, use `yarn build:codespaces` for building

## Testing Commands
- Use `yarn test:unit` to run all unit tests
- Use `yarn test:unit path/to/test-file.unit.spec.js` to run a specific test file
- Use `yarn test:unit --app-folder app-name` to run tests for a specific app folder
- Use `yarn test:unit --coverage` to run tests with coverage
- Use `yarn test:coverage-app {app-name}` to run coverage for a specific app
- Use `yarn cy:open` to open Cypress UI test runner for a user
- Use `yarn cy:run` to run Cypress tests from command line for agent testing
- Before running Cypress tests, ensure vets-website is served on port 3001 with `yarn watch --env entry=app-name` or `nohup yarn watch --env entry=app-name > /dev/null 2>&1 &`
- Prefer Cypress tests over manual browser testing
- Cypress tests require vets-api to NOT be running (APIs are mocked by tests)

## Additional Testing Options
- Use `yarn test:unit --log-level trace` to run tests with stack traces
- Use `yarn test:unit src/applications/path/to/tests/**/*.unit.spec.js` to run tests with glob patterns
- Use `yarn test:unit --help` for test runner usage help
- Use `yarn cy:run --spec "path/to/test-file.cypress.spec.js"` to run specific Cypress tests
- Use `yarn cy:run --browser chrome` to run Cypress tests on specific browser
- Use `yarn cy:run:localreports app-folder` to run Cypress tests with reports

## Cypress testing workflow
1. Ensure localhost:3001 is running. If it is not then start dev server using yarn watch in the background.
2. Start dev server in background with `nohup yarn watch --env entry=app-name > /dev/null 2>&1 &`
3. Run Cypress tests with `yarn cy:run --spec "path/to/cypress-test.js"`
4. Stop the dev server when done testing.

## Mock API Development
- Use `yarn mock-api --responses path/to/responses.js` to run mock API server
- Common API responses available in `src/platform/testing/local-dev-mock-api/common.js`
- To simulate login, use `localStorage.setItem('hasSession', true)` in browser console

## Remote API Development
- When using remote API with `yarn watch --env api=https://dev-api.va.gov`, disable CORS in browser
- Note: ID.me will redirect to the API environment (e.g., dev.va.gov)
- Port 3001 is used for local development server

## Common Utilities
- Use `yarn reset:env` to clean environment (node modules, Babel cache, reinstall)
- Use `yarn lint` to run all linters, `yarn lint:js` for JavaScript only
- Use `yarn lint:js:changed:fix` to fix lint issues in changed files
- Use `yarn update:schema` to update vets-json-schema to latest
- Use `yarn new:app` to create new React applications

## Forms
- For understanding valid uiSchema and schema web component patterns, reference `src/platform/forms-system/src/js/web-component-patterns/web-component-patterns-catalog.json`.
- For understanding a form's name, directory path, entryName and rootUrl, reference `src/applications/manifest-catalog.json`.

## Tool Calling and Efficiency
- When performing multiple independent operations, call tools simultaneously rather than sequentially for maximum efficiency.
- Examples of parallel operations: reading multiple files, viewing different directories, running git status and git diff together.
- Only call tools sequentially when one depends on the output of another.
- Batch file edits to the same file in a single response when possible.

## Repository Structure
- `src/platform/` - Shared platform code and utilities used across all applications.
- `src/applications/` - Individual React applications, each with their own `manifest.json`.
- `config/` - Webpack and build configuration files.
- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines.
- Each application should be self-contained with its own tests, components, and routes.

## Code Review and Quality
- Always run linters before committing: `yarn lint:js:working:fix`.
- Test changes frequently and iteratively.
- For accessibility, ensure all code meets WCAG 2.2 AA and Section 508 standards.
- Use existing patterns and components from the design system rather than creating new ones.
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the specific issue being addressed.

## Documentation
- Update README.md if adding new commands or changing workflows.
- Document complex logic with comments that explain "why" not "what".
- Keep API documentation up to date when changing endpoints or data structures.
- Follow existing documentation patterns in the repository.
