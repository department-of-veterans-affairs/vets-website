## Are you removing, renaming or moving a folder in this PR?
- [ ] No, I'm not changing any folders (skip to Summary and delete the rest of this section)
- [ ] Yes, I'm removing, renaming or moving a folder

If the folder you changed contains a `manifest.json`, search for its `entryName` in the content-build [registry.json](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/blob/main/src/applications/registry.json) (the `entryName` there will match).

If an entry for this folder exists in content-build and you are:
1. **Deleting a folder**:
   1. First search `vets-website` for _all_ instances of the `entryName` in your `manifest.json` and remove them in a separate PR. Look particularly for references in `src/applications/static-pages/static-pages-entry.js` and `src/platform/forms/constants.js`. _**If you do not do this, other applications will break!**_
      - _Add the link to your merged vets-website PR here_
   2. Then, Delete the application entry in [registry.json](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/blob/main/src/applications/registry.json) and merge that PR **before** this one
      - _Add the link to your merged content-build PR here_

2. **Renaming or moving a folder**: Update the entry in the [registry.json](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/blob/main/src/applications/registry.json), but do not merge it until your vets-website changes here are merged. The content-build PR must be merged immediately after your vets-website change is merged in to avoid CI errors with content-build (and Tugboat).

### :warning: TeamSites :warning:
Examples of a TeamSite: https://va.gov/health and https://benefits.va.gov/benefits/. This scenario is also referred to as the "injected" header and footer. You can reach out in the `#sitewide-public-websites` Slack channel for questions.

Did you change site-wide styles, platform utilities or other infrastructure?
- [ ] No
- [ ] Yes, and I used the [proxy-rewrite steps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/tree/main/src/applications/proxy-rewrite#that-sounds-normal-so-whats-the-proxy-all-about) to test the injected header scenario
