This file is here to publish releases to https://packagist.org/packages/va-gov/web, so that the CMS CI system can install it and update it using standard composer processes, and so that we can run tests across both systems. See https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms for the CMS repo, and stand by for more documentation.",
